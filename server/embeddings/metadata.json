Accordingly, financial education provides you the basic life skill to build a secure financial future. Proper financial knowledge can improve your ability to save for your long term goals and prevent you and your family from financial exigencies. It is important to know the following concepts: b. Savings and Investing Saving is the excess of your income over your expenditure. Generally, savings is in the form of savings bank account and cash. Your money is very safe in a savings account, earning a small rate of interest and you can get back your money as and when you need it (high liquidity) . Whereas when you are investing, you are setting your money aside for long term goals. It is normal for investments to rise and fall in value over time. However, in the end, prudent investments can earn a lot more than in your savings account. c. Budgeting The first step in your financial planning is budgeting - a process for tracking, planning and controlling the inflow and outflow of your income. It entails identifying all the sources of income and taking into account all current and future expenses, with an aim to meet your financial goals. The primary aim of a budgeting is to ensure reasonable savings after providing for all expenses. Benefits of budgeting \u2022 it puts checks and balances in place in order to prevent overspending at various levels; \u2022 it takes into account the unexpected need for funds; \u2022 it disciplines you in matters of earning and spending; and \u2022 it helps you to maintain same standard of living even after post retirement d. Inflation effects on Investments While planning your investment, it is important to take into account the effects of inflation on your investments. Inflation is the rise in prices of goods and services. As the prices of goods and services increase, the value of rupee goes down and you will not be able to purchase as much with those rupees as you could have in the last month or last year.",

    "text": "The effect of inflation on investment can be better understood with the following illustration: Say that your monthly consumption of petrol is 10 litres, costing you ` 500 @ ` 50 / litre. Further, you meet this expense out of the monthly interest income of ` 500, earned from your fixed deposit. If the inflation rate during the year is 10%, then price of petrol per litre would increase from ` 50 to ` 55 / litre. Accordingly, the next year you will not be able to purchase 10 litres of petrol, now costing ` 55 / litre, out your interest income of ` 500 from your fixed deposit. Hence your financial plan should aim to earn returns above the rate of inflation. e. Risk and Return Risk and return go hand in hand. Risk is loosely defined as the chance of loosing all or part of your money invested. The good news is that investment risk comes with the potential for return \u2013 which makes the activity worthwhile. The basic thing to remember about risk is that it increases as the potential return increases. Essentially, higher the risk, the higher is the potential return. (Do not forget the two words - \u201cpotential return\u201d. There is no guarantee). f. Power of Compounding As you pursue your financial planning, the most powerful tool for creating wealth safely and surely is the magical \u2018power of compounding\u2019. If you park your money in an investment with a given return, and then reinvest those earnings as you receive them, your investment grows exponentially over time. Illustratively, if you set aside a sum of say ` 5,000 every month from the age of 25, earning interest at the rate of 10% p.a., in 60 years you will have with you funds worth more than ` 1 crore. However, if you start at 40 with the same amount and rate of interest, the fund accumulated will amount to only around ` 33 lakh. Hence, it is always advisable to start savings early to enjoy the benefits of power of compounding g. Time Value of Money Money has time value. As the time passes, the value of money decreases. This means that the value of a thousand rupee note you have today is higher than its value five years hence, even if there is no inflation. This is because we prefer consumption today to consumption in future",

Products Available: There are a large variety of financial products available for investment. You need to choose the best product or the best combination of products to meet your preference and objectives. Your choice generally takes a balance view of three factors, namely, Liquidity, Safety and Return depending on the stage of life. a. Savings Related products Bank deposits are generally safe because they are partly covered by deposit insurance and banks have high capital requirements. The banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. They offer various types of deposits, depending on the needs of the customer. Bank deposits are preferred more for their liquidity and safety than for their returns. b. Investment Related Products Company fixed deposits are fixed deposit scheme offered by (manufacturing) companies. They are similar to bank fixed deposits but entail lesser liquidity and usually carry higher risk and return. Capital market offers products like equity, debt, hybrid instruments and various mutual fund schemes. Each of this investment class carries different risk-return profile and is covered separately under \u2018products available in capital markets\u2019. c. Protection Related Products \u2022 Life Insurance is a contract providing for payment of a sum of money to the person assured or, following him to the person entitled to receive the same, on the happening of a certain event. \u2022 Term Life Insurance Lump sum is paid to the designated beneficiary in case of the death of the insured. \u2022 Endowment Policies Provide for periodic payment of premia and a lump sum amount either in the event of death of the insured or on the date of expiry of the policy, whichever occurs earlier. \u2022 Units Linked Insurance Policy (ULIP) provides a combination of risk cover and investment.

    "text": "An overview of capital market Generally, the personal savings of an entrepreneur along with contributions from friends and relatives are the source of fund to start new or to expand existing business. This may not be feasible in case of large projects as the required contribution from the entrepreneur (promoter) would be very large even after availing term loan; the promoter may not be able to bring his / her share (equity capital).Thus availability of capital can be a major constraint in setting up or expanding business on a large scale However, instead of depending upon a limited pool of savings of a small circle of friends and relatives, the promoter has the option of raising money from the public across the country by selling (issuing) shares of the company. For this purpose, the promoter can invite investment to his or her venture by issuing offer document which gives full details about track record, the company, the nature of the project, the business model, the expected profitability etc. If you are comfortable with this proposed venture, you may invest and thus become a shareholder of the company. Through aggregation, even small amounts available with a very large number of individuals translate into usable capital for corporates. Your small savings of, say, even ` 5,000 can contribute in setting up, say, a ` 5,000 crore Cement or Steel plant. This mechanism by which corporates raise money from public is called the primary markets. Importantly, when you, as a shareholder, need your money back, you can sell these shares to other or new investors. Such trades do not reduce or alter the company\u2019s capital. Stock exchanges bring such sellers and buyers together and facilitate trading. Therefore, companies raising money from public are required to list their shares on the stock exchange. This mechanism of buying and selling shares through stock exchange is known as the secondary markets. As a shareholder, you are part owner of the company and entitled to all the benefits of ownership, including dividend (company\u2019s profit distributed to owners). Over the years if the company performs well, other investors would like to become owners of this performing company by buying its shares. This increase in demand for shares leads to increase in its price. You then have the option of selling your shares at a higher price than at which you purchased it. You can thus increase your wealth,",

You can thus increase your wealth, provided you make the right choice. The reverse is also true! Apart from shares, there are many other financial instruments ( securities ) used for raising capital.

If you prefer fixed income, you may invest in these instruments which may give you higher rate of interest than bank fixed deposit, because of the",

If you have constraints like time, wherewithal, small amount etc. to invest in the market directly, Mutual Funds (MFs), which are regulated entities, provide an alternative avenue. They collect money from many investors and invest the aggregate amount in the markets in a professional and transparent manner. The returns from these investments net of management fees are available to you as a MF unit holder. MFs offer various schemes, like those investing only in equity or debt, index funds, gold funds, etc. to cater to risk appetite of various investors. Even with very small amounts, you can invest in MF schemes through monthly systematic investment plans (SIP). The institutions, players and mechanism that bring suppliers and users of capital together, is known as capital market. It allows people to do more with their savings by providing variety of assets thereby enhancing the wealth of investors who make the right choice. Simultaneously, it enables entrepreneurs to do more with their ideas and talent, facilitating capital formation. Thus capital market mobilizes savings and channelizes it, through securities , into preferred entrepreneurs. It is not that the providers of funds meet the user of and exchange funds for securities. It is because the securities offered by the users may not match the preference of the providers of funds. There are a large variety of intermediaries who bring the providers and user of funds together to facilitate the transactions. The market is supervised by SEBI. It ensures supply of quality securities and non-manipulated demand for them. It develops best market practices and takes enforcement actions against the miscreants.

The investor confidence is the key prerequisite for the emergence of a vibrant and deep capital market. The role of regulator in creating and enhancing investor confidence is, therefore, paramount. Accordingly, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was set up by an Act of Parliament of India in April, 1992 with a mandate to \u2022 Protect the interest of investors \u2022 Promote the development of and \u2022 Regulate the securities market Market regulation SEBI prescribes the conditions for issuer companies to raise capital from the pubic so as to protect the interest of the suppliers of capital (investors). The extensive disclosures prescribed for issuers facilitate informed investment decision making by investors while simultaneously ensuring quality of the issuer. Further, it has prescribed norms for such corporates on \u2018on going\u2019 basis and also during their restructuring (like substantial acquisition, buy back and delisting of shares) to safeguard the interest of investors. To ensure fair and high standards of service to investors, SEBI allows only fit and proper entities to operate in the capital markets as intermediaries. In this regard, it has prescribed detailed and uniform norms of their registration. Further, to ensure market integrity, it has prescribed norms for fair market practices including prohibiting fraudulent and unfair trade practices and insider trading. Detailed norms for safeguarding the interest of investors in secondary markets have also been prescribed. SEBI also prescribes conditions for operation of collective investor schemes, including Mutual Funds. Market development: On an on going basis, SEBI initiates measures to widen and deepen the securities markets by bringing changes in market micro and macrostructure. The major market development measures undertaken by SEBI include shift from the non transparent open out cry system to the transparent screen based on line trading system, elimination of problems of physical certificates by shifting to electronic mode (demat), implementing robust risk management framework in stock market trading etc. In the recent past SEBI has initiated ASBA (application supported by blocked amount) to eliminate problems pertaining to refunds in public issues.

Besides, SEBI also has a comprehensive mechanism to facilitate redressal of investor\u2019s grievances. Further, in keeping with its belief that an informed investor is a protected investor, SEBI promotes education and awareness of investors. Moreover, mechanisms for dispute redressal (arbitration at stock exchanges) and to compensate investors have also been provided. Enforcement: SEBI ascertains compliance to its norms by carrying out inspections of registered intermediaries, investigations and while processing of documents filed with it, including investors complaints. SEBI is vested with the power of civil court to call for information and records, to issue summons, to inspect and to investigate entities associated with securities markets. If breach of norms is established, SEBI suspends or cancels the license granted to intermediaries. Besides, SEBI issues prohibitive and cease and desist orders against intermediaries and non intermediaries and also imposes monetary penalties through adjudication proceedings. Apart from these civil proceedings, SEBI also launches criminal proceedings against entities for breach of norms. All such orders of SEBI are available in the website (www.sebi.gov.in), serving as a warning to potential defaulter. ***",

It is also mandated to promote the development of, and to regulate the securities market. An investor enjoys investing, if (i) he knows how to invest; (ii) he has full knowledge of the market; (iii) the market is safe and there are no miscreants; and (iv) there are arrangements for redressal in case of grievances. Accordingly, SEBI\u2019s investor protection strategy has four elements. First, build the capacity of investors through education and awareness to enable an investor to take informed investment decisions. SEBI endeavours to ensure that the investor learns investing, that is, he obtains and uses information required for investing, evaluates various investment options to suit his specific goals, ascertains his rights and obligations in a particular investment, deals through registered intermediaries, takes necessary precautions, seeks help in case of any grievance, etc. SEBI has been organizing investor education and awareness workshops directly, and through investor associations and market participants, and been encouraging market participants to organize similar programmes. It maintains an updated, comprehensive web site for education of investors. It publishes various kinds of cautions through media. It responds to the queries of investors through telephone, e-mails, letters, and in person for those who visit SEBI office. Second, make available every detail relevant for investment in public domain. SEBI has adopted disclosure based regulatory regime. Under this framework, issuers and intermediaries disclose relevant details about themselves, the products, the market and the regulations so that the investor can take informed investment decisions based on such disclosures. SEBI has prescribed and monitors various initial and continuous disclosures. Third, ensure that the market has systems and practices which make transactions safe. SEBI has taken various measures such as screen based trading system, dematerialization of securities, T+2 rolling settlement, and framed various regulations to regulate intermediaries, issue and trading of securities, corporate restructuring, etc. to protect the interests of investors in securities. It also ensures that only the fit and proper persons are allowed to operate in the market, every participant has incentive to comply with the prescribed standards, and the miscreant are awarded exemplary punishment.

For example, if an architect submitted a plan in a competition for construction of a building, the prize won by him, is income from profession. iii) A gift from a relative is not income a t all . A gift from a relative does not become income merely because it is repeated year after year.

Hence, it is taxable. Other provisions relating to Casual Income : i) Expens es are not deductible : If expenses are incurred to receive casual income, such expenses are not deductible from any income. For example, an individual purchases lottery tickets, the cost of lottery tickets is not deductible from any income. ii) Set - off o ff losses not permitted : If instead of casual income there is casual loss, such loss cannot be set - off from any income.

    "text": "8 Common Investing Mistakes to Avoid By Updated August 31, 2024 WILLIAM ARTZBERGER Reviewed by JULIUS MANSA Fact checked by RYAN EICHLER Investing is by no means always easy and profits are never guaranteed. There are countless books on investing and everyone has different tips and tricks that work for them. Even professional investors aren't always right even after years of practice. Additionally, every investor is different, with different investment goals, risk tolerances, and knowledge. However, there are some common mistakes that all investors should avoid, which we discuss below. 1. Not Understanding the Investment One of the world's most successful investors, Warren Buffett , cautions against investing in companies whose business models you don't understand. The best way to avoid this is to build a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. If you do invest in individual stocks, make sure you thoroughly understand each company those stocks represent before you invest. 2. Falling in Love With a Company KEY TAKEAWAYS Mistakes are common when investing, but some can be easily avoided if you can recognize them. The worst mistakes are failing to set up a long-term plan, allowing emotion and fear to influence your decisions, and not diversifying a portfolio. Other mistakes include falling in love with a stock for the wrong reasons and trying to time the market. Top Stories Is Your Salary Competitive?

    "text": "Too often, when we see a company we've invested in do well, it's easy to fall in love with it and forget that we bought the stock as an investment. Always remember, you bought this stock to make money. If any of the fundamentals that prompted you to buy into the company change, consider selling the stock. 3. Lack of Patience A slow and steady approach to portfolio growth will yield greater returns in the long run. Expecting a portfolio to do something other than what it is designed to do is a recipe for disaster. This means you need to keep your expectations realistic with regard to the timeline for portfolio growth and returns. 4. Too Much Investment Turnover Turnover , or jumping in and out of positions, is another return killer. Unless you're an institutional investor with the benefit of low commission rates, the transaction costs can eat you alive\u2014not to mention the short-term tax rates and the opportunity cost of missing out on the long-term gains of other sensible investments. 5. Attempting to Time the Market Trying to time the market also kills returns. Successfully timing the market is extremely difficult. Even institutional investors often fail to do it successfully. A well-known study, \"Determinants of Portfolio Performance\" ( Financial Analysts Journal, 1986), conducted by Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower covered American pension fund returns. This study showed that, on average, nearly 94% of the variation of returns over time was explained by the investment policy decision. In layperson's terms, this means that most of a portfolio's return can be explained by the asset allocation decisions you make, not by timing or even security selection.

    "text": "6. Waiting to Get Even Getting even is just another way to ensure you lose any profit you might have accumulated. It means that you are waiting to sell a loser until it gets back to its original cost basis. Behavioral finance calls this a \"cognitive error.\" By failing to realize a loss, investors are actually losing in two ways. First, they avoid selling a loser, which may continue to slide until it's worthless. Second, there's the opportunity cost of the better use of those investment dollars. 7. Failing to Diversify While professional investors may be able to generate alpha (or excess return over a benchmark ) by investing in a few concentrated positions, common investors should not try this. It is wiser to stick to the principle of diversification. In building an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund portfolio, it's important to allocate exposure to all major spaces. In building an individual stock portfolio, include all major sectors. As a general rule of thumb, do not allocate more than 5% to 10% to any one investment. 8. Letting Your Emotions Rule Perhaps the number one killer of investment return is emotion. The axiom that fear and greed rule the market is true. Investors should not let fear or greed control their decisions. Instead, they should focus on the bigger picture. Stock market returns may deviate wildly over a shorter time frame, but, over the long term, historical returns tend to favor patient investors. An investor ruled by emotion may see this type of negative return and panic sell, when in fact they probably would have been better off holding the investment for the long term. In fact, patient investors may benefit from the irrational decisions of other investors.

    "text": "Proactively determine where you are in the investment life cycle, what your goals are, and how much you need to invest to get there. If you don't feel qualified to do this, seek a reputable financial planner. Also, remember why you are investing your money, and you will be inspired to save more and may find it easier to determine the right allocation for your portfolio. Temper your expectations to historical market returns. Do not expect your portfolio to make you rich overnight. A consistent, long-term investment strategy over time is what will build wealth. Put Your Plan on Automatic As your income grows, you may want to add more. Monitor your investments. At the end of every year, review your investments and their performance. Determine whether your equity-to-fixed-income ratio should stay the same or change based on where you are in life. Allocate Some \"Fun\" Money We all get tempted by the need to spend money at times. It's the nature of the human condition. So, instead of trying to fight it, go with it. Set aside \"fun investment money.\" You should limit this amount to no more than 5% of your investment portfolio, and it should be money that you can afford to lose. Do not use retirement money. Always seek investments from a reputable financial firm. Because this process is akin to gambling, follow the same rules you would in that endeavor. 1. Limit your losses to your principal (do not sell calls on stocks you don't own, for instance). 2. Be prepared to lose 100% of your investment. 3. Choose and stick to a pre-determined limit to determine when you will walk away. What Are Common Investing Mistakes?

But some fundamental notions have survived even such a deep Schumpeterian catharsis. Among the survivors is the belief that financial literacy is important in both developed and developing economies alike. There is virtually no country that has developed and matured without a corresponding deepening of the financial sector. And such deepening is possible only when individuals and households are financially literate and are able to make informed choices about their savings and investments. Indeed it is possible to argue that the sub prime problem would not have grown to the explosive proportions that it did if people had been financially more \u2018literate\u2019. 2. India clocked average growth of nine percent in the period 2004-08 before the global financial crisis interrupted the growth trajectory. One of the key drivers of this growth has been the increased savings rate in the economy. The increase in savings itself has been a consequence of the changing demographics and the welcome trend among households of shifting from physical savings to financial savings. In order for us to achieve the double digit growth that we aspire to, it is critical that the savings rate in the economy not only reaches the pre-crisis level but surpasses it. This will require both supply and demand side conditions to be met. On the supply side, our financial markets need to design and supply product that households with low but growing incomes can use. On the demand side, we need to make people financially literate so that they know what they want and are equipped to make choices from among the wide array of financial products on offer in the market. 3. Nurturing and encouraging these supply and demand side initiatives is at the heart of the Reserve Bank\u2019s \u2018Financial Inclusion\u2019 initiative. We want our financial markets to innovate products that combine \u2018safety, return and liquidity\u2019 to meet the needs of low and middle income households. We also want our households to be financially literate so that they can make decisions on what, when, how and where to save. There are obviously several ways of widening and deepening financial literacy and the mode and method depend on the targeted audience. The Reserve Bank endeavours to reach out to every type of audience through its several initiatives. 4. This book in your hands, ICanDo",

The Reserve Bank endeavours to reach out to every type of audience through its several initiatives. 4. This book in your hands, ICanDo Financial Planning, is a valuable addition to the several ongoing efforts of the Reserve Bank towards enhancing financial literacy. It is aimed at youth who are just about getting into jobs and careers, and who will have to wade through a complex array of financial products and make judgements. It is an attempt towards educating the readers on the importance of thrift and equipping them with the skills of planning and budgeting for a financially secure future. Written in an easy style and simple language with live examples, the book\u2019s central message is that people can improve their financial security through defining their financial goals, then drawing up and implementing a savings and investment plan to achieve those goals. 5. There are several books and readings available on financial planning. This book\u2019s USP is that it allows you to read it and use it in a flexible way since each topic and chapter is practically self-contained. I hope you will find this book to be a rewarding learning experience and helpful in your financial planning. D. Subbarao Governor Reserve Bank of India Foreword Mumbai March 22, 2010",

Plus there hasn\u2019t been that good earning from the farm. We will have to spend more money on irrigating the land. And do not forget the medical bills. Your mother needs an elaborate treatment for her asthma. House repair can wait till the next year.\u201d Ramesh realized that it was indeed not possible at the moment to think of any further expense. But he also believed that repairing their house was a big need too. Ramesh, a 25-year-old mechanical engineer, had set up a small farm equipment repairs business in his village just a year ago. With a bank loan, his engineering degree from a reputed college and a 2 year work experience in a factory in a big town, Ramesh was confident about making his venture successful. His business kicked off well as farmers no more needed to travel outside the village for repairs and were happy with Ramesh\u2019s services. And now, Ramesh wished he could make those little changes that could improve his family\u2019s quality of life. But Ramesh\u2019s family did not have much fund in saving. And just one year in business, he was barely managing to repay the installments on time from his profits. \u2018House does need repairs. Am I going to get my bride in this old tattered house?,\u2019 Ramesh thought to himself, as his father left. \u2018But father has a point. Where can we get all this money from?\u2019 He was not sure if he should borrow the money from friends. \u2018It will not look good.\u2019 Just as he was consumed by the thought, he was reminded of somebody who could help. He ran towards a well in front of the village school, reached for a coin in his pocket and tossed it. * It was not long ago. Just more than a year back, as Ramesh was heading back home from the big town where he worked, he passed by this well. The sight of the well, in front of his primary school, took him back to the fond memories of his childhood and the well. Just then something happened that bothered him. He saw a few school kids throwing biscuit wrappers in the well.",

The sight of the well, in front of his primary school, took him back to the fond memories of his childhood and the well. Just then something happened that bothered him. He saw a few school kids throwing biscuit wrappers in the well. Before he could stop them, the damage was done and the kids had run away. When Ramesh peeped in the well, he saw a whole lot of garbage dumped inside. Ramesh was disheartened. This was a sacred well for him. It used to be clean and had quenched his thirst many a times in the harshest of summers. Ramesh decided to clean it up and protect it from any further littering. The very second day in village, Ramesh spent cleaning the well and constructing a garbage bin in front of the school. Just as he sat down to relax under a tree, he saw a thick fog emerge from the well. As the fog scattered, a man in white robe emerged. The man looked regal, with a bright aura around his majestic figure. \u201cHello well-wisher,\u201d the man said in an authoritative tone, \u201cyou made me happy by doing good to my home-this well.\u201d \u201cWho are you? And do you stay in here?\u201d Ramesh quizzed. \u201cWell, not always but you can say this is my holiday home,\u201d the man answered, with a smile. \u201cAs for who I am, they call me Sri Wishkar as I fulfil wishes of do-gooders. Why don\u2019t you give me a chance to fulfill your 3 wishes as a token of gratitude?\u201d Ramesh was taken aback. He did not know what to say. But simple yet smart that he was, he asked for some time to think. \u201cCan I think about it and ask as and when I need something?\u201d he asked. \u201cOK\u201d Sri Wishkar agreed, after a pause. \u201cJust toss a coin, whenever you have a wish for me and I shall appear to grant it to you. I owe you 3 wishes. Keep doing good, young man,\u201d said Sri Wishkar, and disappeared. * Wish more, at the toss of a coin!",

Ramesh told him his wish of renovating his house, and voila, it was granted to him in no time. Ramesh got a repaired and renovated house. Years passed by. Ramesh\u2019s small business did well, just as it did in the beginning. He had earned himself a good life, a happy family and a reputation of being a wise gentleman in the village and around. His daughter was studying law in a nearby metro town. And his son wished he could study medicine abroad. Studying abroad meant huge expenses. Ramesh was just not ready for them. But his son was a bright student and he did not want to compromise on his children\u2019s future. Ramesh\u2019s good deed that had allowed him 3 wishes from Sri Wishkar, came to his rescue this time as well. Sri Wishkar granted him his children\u2019s higher education (and subsequently a bright future). \u201cYou are a smart man Ramesh,\u201d Sri Wishkar commented after granting Ramesh his second wish. \u201cBut, I hope you do not make me wait another 20 years for your third wish.\u201d Both laughed. \u201cOh no, my lord, you have indeed helped me in time of my need,\u201d Ramesh answered, \u201cI would not have been able to do what I did, had it not been for you. Now, I want you to grant me my third wish as well.\u201d Wishkar listened as Ramesh spoke. He was curious what his smart do-gooder had on his wish list now. \u201cI am thankfully doing well,\u201d Ramesh started to talk. \u201cMy small business is good enough to support me and my wife currently. My children, thanks to you, would do well for themselves with their priceless education. What I now wish from you is that you provide for my wife\u2019s financial needs when I am no more to take care of her. I do not want to leave that to my children. You never know how situations develop. I want my wife to live with dignity and peace. I hope you can grant me this last wish of mine.\u201d \u201cOf course, wise man!\u201d Sri Wishkar was delighted at Ramesh\u2019s request. \u201cYou have used my powers judiciously and I am happy that I granted you your wishes.

We may not bump into Sri Wishkar (though that should not refrain us from doing good deeds) and have our wishes fulfilled at the toss of a coin. But that should not hold us back from having a stable, peaceful living, and a brighter and wealthier future. All we need to do is foresee life\u2019s challenges and opportunities and plan for them, coupled with an \u2018ICanDo It\u2019 attitude.

    "text": "9 Having your own money in your hand every month does not guarantee you the lifestyle you deserve throughout your life. Circumstances and needs always keep changing. Today\u2019s sound financial situation does not guarantee an equally sound future. And hence, no or improper financial planning can be disastrous. A loss of income, even temporary, can eat into your savings or can lead to debt. An uninsured loss can wipe out your accumulated wealth. Insufficient savings can force a reduced lifestyle during retirement. Frequent or unplanned borrowings can leave negative money i.e., debts for future. Also, poor tax planning can result in paying higher taxes than what you are liable to pay. All this, combined with changes in your life cycle needs and/or external economic changes can make you and your future generations financially vulnerable. You would need to plan and manage your current income (the money you earn today) and your future income (money you can expect to earn in future) according to your life cycle needs. A proper financial planning will help you achieve financial freedom, when you would no longer need to work for money, instead your money would work for you. What is Financial Planning? Financial planning is a process of planning and managing your money (current finances) to meet your life goals. Your current finances would mean everything that constitutes your money today\u2014income, expenses, savings, assets and liabilities. Your life goals could be higher education, buying a house, planning for retirement, saving for marriage/child\u2019s education. Proper and timely planning of your personal finance is important to achieve financial security throughout your life cycle, and to build wealth. Right Time to Start Financial Planning The moment you get to know about financial planning or realize that you need to have a plan, is the right moment to start financial planning. The earlier this moment arrives in your life the better. Therefore, young people who have just started to earn can make the best of this tool. Yet \u2018better late than never\u2019 is an equally appropriate phrase for those who have not yet started planning their finances, but now wish to have money for everything\u2014children\u2019s education, clearing debts, secure retirement and emergencies.

    "text": "11 Common Financial Myths and Mistakes ( Things That Can Set You Back ) Many a times on a road journey, a small ditch or a diversion can cause a big delay or inconvenience. Similarly, even small misconceptions about certain financial concepts/practices may delay your financial planning process. Being aware of these in the beginning will help you avoid them for a smoother ride. Common Financial Mistakes 1. Spending frivolously It may not seem like much at the time, but even small expenses when added up can lead to a big hole in your pocket. Those colas and lattes, upgrading the cell phones, regular movie tickets and hot corns all amount to a huge unnecessary expense. A Rs.50 cappuccino by the sea with friends every evening will amount to Rs.1500 in a month. A first-day-first-show Rs.200 movie ticket every Friday and Rs.20 corn effectively means an outflow of Rs.880 from your wallet. Saving this \u2018additional\u2019 amount every month can allow you Rs.28,560 for something bigger over a year. 2. Mindless use of credit cards Using credit card means spending borrowed money. Credit cards are a convenient way to carry money. But they come with double-digit interest rates. If the payments on your credit card are not made on time, the money you will have to pay back will be much more than what you spent on your card and that too within months. Young people are most susceptible to fall for this mistake. Paying your credit card bills always in full and on time, would help you get the best of this handy tool. 3. Caring little for regular savings Contributing regularly to savings account, either for emergencies or for investment, is one of the best wealth building habits, often ignored by many. Notwithstanding the nominal returns on savings, building a healthy corpus by saving regularly is essential for sustenance and growth. 4. Investing based on half knowledge or imitation Wise investment decisions should be based on one\u2019s risk profile, needs and priorities, and financial goals. As these differ from individual to individual, investment strategies also should be different. Just because an investment strategy has worked for someone (even for best of friends), does not mean it would work for you. Investment decisions should be made only after thoroughly knowing your investment needs and matching them with the options available to you. Common Financial Myths 1. Attitudinal Myths: Myth A:",

As these differ from individual to individual, investment strategies also should be different. Just because an investment strategy has worked for someone (even for best of friends), does not mean it would work for you. Investment decisions should be made only after thoroughly knowing your investment needs and matching them with the options available to you. Common Financial Myths 1. Attitudinal Myths: Myth A: I have a lot of money (or very little money), hence financial planning is not for me. Truth: Everyone benefits from financial planning. Whether you have a lot or little money, you cannot achieve your financial goals consistently without a plan. Financial planning not only helps you achieve your goals, it also helps you monitor and review your progress with your finances.",

    "text": "12 Myth B: Financial planning seems to be a tedious and time-consuming process and I am far too busy to spend my time on planning. Truth: Anything new seems to be tedious at first. But it is worth \u2018investing\u2019 some of your time on acquiring this skill as it would enable you to worry less about and enjoy more of your hard-earned money. Seeking professional help from chartered accountants, financial planners will make the beginning easier. You should still ideally spend some time planning finances or overseeing and discussing from time to time with your planner, as no one would understand your needs and goals better than you do. Myth C: If I earn enough now, I would have enough money during retirement. Truth: The only way to retire rich is to plan and manage your finances well today, no matter how much or less you earn today. There are many cases of millionaires retiring paupers and of modest earners retiring rich. The difference lies in the way they manage their cash, cash flows, investment, debt and insurance. 2. Investment Myths: Myth A: Investing in mutual funds is risk-free and guarantees huge returns. Truth: No investment is risk-free, it can be either high risk or low risk and the risk is generally proportional to the returns it offers. Mutual funds are managed by professional wealth managers or portfolio managers, whose main task is to create an investment portfolio by wisely balancing the risks and returns. Thus, the objective of the fund manager becomes to minimize risks and maximize returns for the investors. But the risks cannot be totally eliminated and the returns can never be promised. Hence, it is advised to read the offer document of the fund carefully to understand what are the risks involved, and what returns one can expect. Myth B: Investing in stock markets is very risky and best avoided. Truth: Stocks are categorized as high risk\u2013high returns investment channel. They have over the years proved to be one of the most profitable investments. Stocks have a significant role of growth to play in a diversified investment portfolio. For young people, with a good risk appetite, it should be one investment that should not be missed. But some look at stock investment as a get-rich-quick formula and \u2018invest\u2019 blindly, without proper knowledge. Such people should certainly avoid stock market investments, at least until they gather some",

Tax Planning Myths Myth A: Whether I do my tax planning in the beginning of the year or towards the end of it, it is one and the same as long as it is done before March 31st. Truth: Legally, for the income tax department, it is one and the same. But financially, if you are doing tax planning (or you think so) just before the year ends, you are at a great loss. Tax planning makes thinking about your future financial needs mandatory today and hence is one opportunity to plan and invest for your financial security\u2014insurance, retirement or long-term investments. Tax planning in the beginning of the year has two distinct advantages\u2014a short-term advantage of saving you tax and a long-term benefit of making the most of the investment opportunities that are still",

    "text": "13 in line with your financial goals. Whereas hastily putting money in any tax saving instrument at the end of the year merely saves you some tax. Besides, proactive tax planning also allows you an option of systematic investment over the year rather than running around and arranging funds for investment at the end of the year. Myth B: Investing in mutual fund qualifies for deductions from my taxable income. Truth: Specific type of mutual funds known as Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) that have a lock-in period of 3 years are counted amongst tax saving investment option. All other types of mutual funds do not qualify for income tax deductions. 4. Credit Card Myths: Myth A: Number of credit cards in my wallet shows how rich I am\u2014the more the number, the richer I am. Truth: This is a common misunderstanding especially amongst young people. More credit cards mean you can spend more of \u2018borrowed\u2019 money, which may tempt you to spend more. If you spend more than what you can repay the next month, you will just pay the minimum amount (amounts, on multiple credit cards). Paying only the minimum amount means that the next time you will have to pay more (much more) than what you spent, due to the high interest applied. This may lead you to further borrowing and more debt, which means lesser money for you in the future. Credit cards do not make you any richer than what you are. But using credit limits much higher than what you can repay in the near future will surely leave you with much lesser money as well as peace of mind. Myth B: It is okay to pay the minimum amount mentioned in my credit card statement every month. Truth: Paying only the minimum amount means (heavy) interest being charged on the balance amount, which you anyway must pay sooner or later, with much more interest later. The sooner you repay all the money spent on credit card, the more beneficial the card will be for you. Paying only the minimum amount every month is one bad habit that many young people get themselves into\u2014leading to mounting debts on them. It is best to avoid it. If you have got into this bad habit, the sooner you get out of it, the better it is for you and your finances.",

The uniqueness of this book lies in its hands-on approach. It is simple content, systematic exercises and inspiring experience sharing, should be helpful to the beginners as well as those conversant with personal finance. This step-by-step manual intends to empower the young reader to construct a complete personal financial portfolio. ICanDo Financial Planning touches upon 5 main parts of personal finance in 5 sections: 1. ICanDo Money Management. 2. ICanDo Financial Goal Setting. 3. ICanDo Investment. 4. ICanDo Planning and Managing Debt. 5. ICanDo Financial Risk Management. Each Section of the book intends to bring about a proper understanding of the topic by: 1. providing relevant information in a simple language under the head \u2018 I Know \u2019, 2. providing Mrs. Bharati\u2019s experiences to learn from and believe that I should and \u2018 I Can \u2019 too, 3. providing worksheets and steps to start financial planning straightaway under the head \u2018 I Do \u2019, and 4. reinforcing important points by summarizing them at the end of the section in the box \u2018 Key Points \u2019. In the last few pages, the book lists a few common financial goals and recommends steps in planning for these goals. What the Book Covers and What It Does Not? The book is a step-by-step manual for financial planning. It covers all the important general steps in personal financial planning through its smart worksheets or checklists. The worksheets are flexible in nature and they should be broadly applicable to the majority of people. Information-wise, the book provides relevant content that is important for making sense of the financial planning process. It touches upon most of the personal finance concepts and practices. But the book does not intend to develop thorough and in-depth understanding of any one concept/practice. Further reading is recommended in such a case, based on individual interest and preference. This book covers the general concepts in investment, insurance and debt and their significance to financial planning. It does not cover the individual topics in details nor does it in any way recommend or advice any particular type or brand of these products. You would need to do further reading for this.

Beginners in personal finance may find it useful to read the book the way it is presented, while referring wherever needed, the glossary of terms in the last few pages. If you are more familiar with financial planning, you may want to start with the worksheets and refer the content under \u2018I Know\u2019 as per need. You may also choose a topic within financial planning that is of current interest or concern to you e.g., investment or debt or cash flow/money management.

Of course there are some days for some of us when we have a lot of time at hand but almost nothing concrete to do. I am no exception! In my college days as a teenager, I was \u2018busy\u2019 taking care of some very basic human needs of food (frequenting the canteen), clothing (following the latest trends and fashion) and shelter (looking for a safe place after bunking classes). As responsible youth, we had very important matters to discuss like, reviewing the latest movie, breaking news of love affairs and heartbreaks on campus, checking out the latest campus styles etc. Elders at home and college would often nag that I was wasting too much time, when it could be better utilised. But so busy was I in all my important activities that I had very little time to think about how much time I really had. As time flew, I graduated from college and joined the workforce. My mornings\u2014the rush hours\u2014would often vanish before I could recover from sleep. Getting ready and rushing to catch a bus, and then tolerating all the speed breakers and traffic jams before reaching the office, barely on time. At office of course I used to be busy as a bee. And then back to the crazy bus ride before reaching home, half drained. Before I knew it the days were gone. Weekends meant doing all the work I could not do over the week\u2014including catching some peaceful sleep and some recreation\u2014movie, shopping, sport, hair cut etc. This routine continued for a few years and left me with time to do only the things that seemed urgent. As I looked around at people I knew\u2014my friends, colleagues\u2014it seemed like the same story with everyone. There simply was no time. Many of us thus felt pressured, many had to overlook their small health problems and carry on, many slept little, most had no time to even sit down and have a peaceful meal. I soon began to realize that because of this \u2018busy\u2019 life, I was also spending unnecessarily\u2014taking taxis just to make it on time, picking up junk food on the way to munch on (instead of a good",

Frequent medication for even slight aches and pains, also meant more expenses. The biggest component though was poor maintenance of the things I had, including my health and fitness. I just didn\u2019t have the time to take care of my health and things like my clothes, computer, phone, bags and shoes and even my scooter, which I would use on weekends. So they would give up way too soon prompting me to rush to buy another one or pay huge repair bills. What made this all worse was my ignorance about it. There was no way to notice this, as I did not have the time to keep account of the expenses. I just realized it by chance when for many months I seemed to spend all my money before I received my salary. And it seemed to be almost similar story for most of my young friends and colleagues. Over the years I have come to believe that management of Time and Money management go hand in hand. You are most likely to have similar attitudes towards money and time. And you are most likely to manage your money the way you manage your time and vice versa. You\u2019d spend more money if your time just goes by in managing day to day or just the urgent tasks. See it for yourself!

    "text": "20 I realized that I was spending unnecessarily only after I started to keeping a regular account of my expenses. It seemed quite tough to keep up the practice initially\u2014I would at times forget to make a timely note of small expenses or goof up with recording expenses on credit. But I persisted as I discovered the power of such a simple thing as making a timely note of the amount I spent everyday. This simple thing allowed me to track my money\u2014where it came from and where it went. And there was a huge motivation, this simple practice subsequently would help build up my reserves. I call this very effective process of record keeping and accounting , analyzing my spending pattern and making a budget to build savings as SMART MONEY MANAGEMENT. We have witnessed the power of this simple yet powerful practice of money management through good times and bad. What I have also witnessed is people finding the practice quite ineffective. But my observation over the years tells me that these are the people who resort to monitoring their expenses and budgeting only in tough economic times and wanting immediate solutions when in problem. Money management is all about recording your money behavior and learning from them. It requires a few trials and should have scope for some errors, until you understand your own spending pattern and figure out a way to save in your budget. Thus such sporadic practice, that too in bad times yields little results. My husband and I have been practising prudent money management for close to 15 years and so diligently that now it is become almost our second nature. By God\u2019s grace, we\u2019ve been having a comfortable living and growing inflow of money.

    "text": "21 No matter how much (or less) you know about investments, stock markets, credit cards and insurance, if you do not know your money well, you are most likely to fail with your financial planning. The first and perhaps the most important step in financial planning is to know your money i.e., your financial position well and then be able to manage it wisely. What makes up \u2018your money\u2019 or financial position? 1 Your income and expenses: What you earn and what and how much you spend determine how much money you have on hand after meeting your needs (and some wants). This \u2018balance\u2019 is an important indicator of your financial position. It can be used as a guideline to plan your finances. A healthy positive balance every month indicates a trend towards a good financial position and a zero or negative balance most of the months corresponds to a weak financial trend (especially if you are not building assets on the way). A healthy positive balance from your income will allow you to build funds for meeting your financial goals. 2 Your assets and liabilities: The amount of assets\u2014items of value\u2014you hold, is a precise indicator of your current and future financial position. Assets tend to add to your income (either now or in future) e.g., investments\u2014in gold/silver, deposits, stocks, mutual funds, art/antique, land etc. Or they help reduce expenses, as in case of owning a house\u2014it saves you taxes and rent. Thus, assets help to strengthen your financial position. On the other hand, liabilities weaken your financial position. Debt\u2014something that you owe is a liability. And so is an old vehicle that needs a lot of fuel and repairs, for the work it is doing. More assets and lesser liabilities would help you better your financial position and strengthen your money.

There are not one but four factors constituting \u2018your money\u2019: income, expenses, assets and liabilities. How well or badly you manage these four together will decide your financial health. Consider the following cases: Asif, 23 \u2014 earns a monthly salary of Rs.10,000 from his call centre job. His average monthly spending on livelihood and looking good is about Rs.9200. He currently has no investments and has an amount of Rs.3200 overdue on his credit card. Babu, 30 \u2014 earns Rs.4,000 per month as a bank clerk. He spends a maximum of Rs.2000 in a month. He has Rs.4800 in his savings account but has not made any significant investments yet. He has to pay an EMI of Rs.800 towards home loan. Chanda, 26 \u2014 is a housewife who gets Rs.4500 from her husband every month towards household expenses. She makes it a point to put Rs.500 in her savings account as soon as she gets her \u2018allowance\u2019. She has managed to build a reserve of Rs.3000 so far. David, 19 \u2014 a third year commerce student has built an investment portfolio of Rs.5000 in mutual funds. He started investing a part of his allowance, cash prize and gifts on his 19th birthday, 6 months back. If income were the only indicator of your financial situation, then Asif\u2019s situation can be considered the strongest. But does he seem to be doing well with his money? Is his financial position really strong? Can he take care of any financial emergency like a job loss or drop in income? In fact, looking at the overall picture, Asif even with his fat paycheck, is in the worst financial situation at present. His expenses are almost as much as his income. And his credit card debt has got him into a financial mess. Considering his meager monthly \u2018balance\u2019 and high interest rate on credit card debt, Asif would need more than 6 months to payback the debt, if nothing else changes. The other three, despite their lesser incomes/allowance, seem to be doing decently in their own way\u2014building saving reserves and assets. Whereas Babu has a decent saving and asset-building home loan, Chanda has her own savings account. David, with age on his side, has started investing and is arguably in the best situation at the moment.",

Whether your occupation (a job or a business) is earning you a lot or little today, it would not be earning you the same all your life. It is best to be aware and prepared for these changes\u2014 in your needs and your income. Saving is one such way that allows you to face such changes with little financial impact. Saving of money becomes possible only if you manage your income and expenses prudently. A healthy reserve or fund you build up by saving regularly enables you to build assets and reduce liabilities. Hence, saving is that common thread that links the four cornerstones of a strong financial foundation. The very first step towards taking charge of laying a sound financial foundation is thus making a commitment to SAVE. I Know \u2013 About Saving Saving means putting aside something (money in this case) for future use. The Savings Mantra - Start NOW! Save First! Save Regularly! Start saving NOW: There is no better time to start saving (if you are not already saving) than NOW. \u2018Time is Money\u2019 and certainly so. The earlier you start saving and get into the habit of saving, the stronger your chances are to face uncertainties and the changing demands of life. Save First: The surest way to save is to make \u2018saving\u2019 your first and most important expense. Set aside a portion of your income as soon as you get your paycheck. Save Regularly: The commitment of saving regularly, month after month, would enable building a healthy savings from smaller incomes as well.",

Visit a branch of private bank, state bank, cooperative bank or post office, whatever is closer and convenient to you. Or call a bank\u2019s call centre for details. What you may need for opening a savings account? 1. Fill up an account opening form and attach a passport size photograph. 2. Proof of identification and/or proof of residence like a ration card, election card, PAN card with electricity bill or a passport. 3. A minimum deposit amount ranging from Rs.10 to Rs.2500 may be required in your account while opening and later you may be required to pay a small annual fee for your savings account. What you may get to operate your savings account with? 1. An account number\u2014that is unique to you. 2. A cheque book (withdrawal slips) to be able to withdraw money from your account. Deposit slips to be able to deposit money in your account. 3. An ATM/ Debit card with a PIN\u2014Personal Identification Number (password) 4.

And using the logic \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d, you are much less likely to spend your money frivolously if it is safely tucked away in a savings account.

Record keeping means organizing and keeping your important documents, records up-to-date so that you can track them whenever you need. An efficient record keeping can be done by following 2 steps: 1. Identifying important records: Dig out all the papers and records that you may have collected over a period of time. Begin sorting. Not all records that you have are necessary to retain over a longer term. Identify the records that are critical from the point of view of them saving you time and money in future, if need be. (Refer to a suggested list of records mentioned on the next page). 2. Develop a method to organize them: The records should be organised in such a way that they become available just when you need them. You may want to use paper filing system, safe boxes or briefcase to store your physical records. Records of your expenses, savings, investments and a handy summary of where all the other records are, can be maintained on a paper or in electronic format on a computer. Make sure that you keep updating the records, adding new relevant ones and disposing ones which have lost their value like the 1-year warranties. Also keeping a simple calendar of payments due (like credit card bills, insurance premiums, savings deposit, loan repayment, etc.) will prove a very worthy financial habit.

A. Trim the extras Almost every household would have spending areas that can be cut or reduced. These areas often eat into probable savings. It would be easy to identify these trim-able spending areas, if you classify your expenses in 3 main groups; 1. Needs or essentials - bills you must pay to run your household and to keep your family healthy and comfortable. Utilities (electricity, gas, water), housing-rent/home loan installments, groceries, health, transport, insurance, education, are your needs. Things that make your life simpler and more convenient can also be regarded as needs. 2.

Allocation guidelines To begin with, you could use the following guideline to allocate your income. Later as you follow the process consistently, you would figure out the allocation formula that works best for you and your family. Your average justified past spending that you would have figured out from your accounts could be your basis to allocate.

(Use the following checklist to make and follow a personalized budget. Check each box alongside the step by placing a tick mark \uf052 in it once you perform the step.) 1. Make budget calculations on a paper (Use your expense records\u2014Worksheets 1.3 and 1.7 and the allocation guidelines mentioned on the previous page.) 2. Deposit the amount you would be saving in your savings account. (Do not forget to update your passbook/register with the recent balance.) 3. Make payments towards stabilizing finances on the due dates \u2014insurance premiums, an emergency account, debt repayment etc. 4. Put the portion you have allocated for investing in an identified instrument or store it separately in an envelope for investing later, when you have enough funds. 5. Identify your various expense groups and make one envelope for each. (Housing (rent/loan), utilities, health care, food and grocery, transportation, clothing, home furnishings, personal care, individual allowances, recreation, gifts/social occasions, interest charges and fees, salaries of maids/workers) 6. Mark the envelopes using words or pictures to represent the individual expense groups. 7. Divide your cash according to your budget calculations. 8. Place the allocated cash in respective envelopes of the spending groups 9. Maintain a record of all the transactions mentioned in this process in a register or an account book. 10. At the time of paying a bill or buying, withdraw money from the envelope marked for that purpose. 11. At the time of shopping, especially for wants, see if there is sufficient cash in that envelope to make the purchase. If there is, go ahead, make the purchase. Otherwise do not make the purchase, at least not until the next allocation is made and the envelope marked for that has enough money to make the purchase. This becomes an automatic regular control. On the other hand, if you do not spend everything in the envelope in a cycle, then the next allocation adds to what is already there resulting in more money for the next cycle. 12. Follow the same process of allocation and use of your earnings every month. Keep updating your accounts. Step 7 \u2013 Envelope Budgeting!",

    "text": "42 Mrs. Bharati\u2019s Common Money Sense Answers to the cases Dear Rama, Since you seem to be so short of time, I would keep my answer to the point. 1. Open a separate savings account and save first. You may have 2 accounts, but if you do not have a separate savings account (a self-controlled \u2018deposit only\u2019 account) it will be a tough task to save. A salary account cannot be a savings account, unless you make it so and decide not to withdraw from it. Hence, open a fresh account and both you and your husband deposit a percentage of your salaries in that account as soon as you get them. 2. Withdraw a fixed amount for spending at the beginning of the month and use envelope budgeting. Refer to previous pages for a detailed process of envelope budgeting. The envelopes would help you track and control your expenses according to different heads. Try not to withdraw anything during the month. Without spending much time on analysis, you would automatically realize within a month or two as to how much you are spending and on what. It would help further if someone in the family can maintain an account of expenses. 3. No credit cards for now. Since you are so busy that you may not be able to keep track of your spending, you should stop using your credit card for now. At least till you get control of your finances. Physical transactions of money are much easier to track and control than the electronic ones. Try this\u2014next time you go shopping, decide to pay by cash rather than by a credit/debit card. You would immediately realize when you are spending more than you should. 4. Get everyone in the household committed to saving. When you are a family of 5, saving can not be an individual goal. You are thinking in the right direction, so get everyone in the family involved and see your savings build up. Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

    "text": "43 Dear Zakir, I appreciate that you read this section and that you are convinced in-principle about money management. What you possibly missed out from the text is that money management can benefit everyone, including people like you. Whoever uses/handles money can benefit by practicing money management process, including small children who receive pocket money. The whole premise of money management is that everyone can build wealth, no matter how much or less he/she earns. Now let us see its significance to your current situation. 1. Since your income is irregular, keeping an account of your income and expenses is very relevant to you. By doing so, you would understand what your actual monthly expenses are and how you fund them in the situations when you earn money and in those when you don\u2019t. What you would eventually understand from this is whether you can save from the months you make money and manage the shortfall when you don\u2019t. This way you might not need to borrow much. This would help you become financially independent faster (if you are currently borrowing from your parents) and/or reduce your liabilities (if you are borrowing from outside). 2. If you start \u2018practicing\u2019 money management from now on, you would be in a much better position to understand and manage money, when you start your employment. This way you can start building wealth right away. 3. If you practice the savings mantra, even if that means putting aside just Rs.50 in a month (in a Post Office savings account), you can see wealth building in time, bit by bit, as you would have never expected. Feature this, Saving per year Rs.600 Annual Interest @ 5% Rs.30 (in the first year, this amount will increase in subsequent years as a result of compounding) In 5 years you will have Rs.4500 (approximate) Therefore, do not waste time, start money management (and other financial planning steps) to get maximum benefits. Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

Physical assets\u2014as most times wealth is in terms of stock portfolio which is largely unsteady and determined by the way stock markets are doing at time. 2. Insurance\u2014life, health, business related. As an emergency can strike off most of your wealth in no time. 3. Balanced Investments\u2014in low risk assured returns type of instruments too. 4. Investment in retirement plans\u2014for your parents as well as for you. In case any of the above is missing, you need to immediately fix it. II. Having said that, you are a young man and still have a long life to live with many future responsibilities and growing needs. Therefore, do not assume the wealth to last you, based on your current expenses and liabilities. Remember that expenses and liabilities have a tendency to grow and you need to factor that in your financial plan. Besides, the optimum use of your wealth can happen when you III. Besides, the optimum use of your wealth can happen when you: 1. Judiciously spend, as you may be doing now. 2. Save and stabilize your finances. 3.

You can fund a needy but deserving student\u2019s education, sponsor a child or the elderly, patronize a dying art. There are many ways you can share your wealth, spread smiles and have a great \u2018social investment\u2019. Think about it, Mrs. Bharati",

It seemed like I had access to everything I wanted without many responsibilities. The present was so beautiful and carefree that I did not have to worry about future. There were many young people like me\u2014we could eat out, watch movies, go shopping, travel and have a gala time. Our income was our pocket money and if we fell short, there were always our parents to back up (though they would do that not without giving a lecture or two on saving money\u2014how boring!) But then, time flies and it did in my case too. I grew up, as they say, gained some wisdom as I added some more years to my age. I grew over the \u2018time-pass\u2019 (petty, in youth lingo) activities. Everyone does some day or the other. I started to find stories of courage, success and excellence inspiring. I looked at people who made a difference to the world, those who could make things happen and I aspired to be like them. I discovered that shopping, eating out were fun, but happiness lied somewhere else. I discovered my passion; I found my dream\u2014to entertain the world. I had talent, enthusiasm and willingness to put in hard work and I thought I had it all. So when I knocked on doors of grand opportunities and they never opened for me, I thought that the world was yet not ready for my kind of talent. But I was not ready to give up my dream. So I decided to take one baby step at a time rather than taking a leap. I set \u2019Goals\u2019 to reach my dream. And it worked. I started as a trainee, then an assistant, became a coordinator and then a full-fledged writer-director. Today all the awards, hits and recognition I have, is a result of achieving those small goals I set, one at a time. Such is the power of goal setting. How I benefited from financial goal setting? Money is important as it opens opportunities and makes things possible. But like in the case of most other things, the power of money increases or decreases depending on the way we use it.

Money is important as it opens opportunities and makes things possible. But like in the case of most other things, the power of money increases or decreases depending on the way we use it. I realized this the most after I got married. The two of us, my husband and I earned good salaries. But as we were setting up everything afresh, we almost had no money by the end of the month and had to wait for our paychecks of next month to buy anything new. Later I realized that most young couples like us, even after months or years of their marriage were mostly living paycheck to paycheck. It was primarily because of the general yuppie (young and upwardly mobile professionals) lifestyle\u2014setting up our homes with all the latest gadgets, filling up our wardrobes with the best brands of clothing and accessories, having extra supplies\u2014spare watches, shoes\u2014 upgrading TV and bikes almost with the pace they were launched in the market, eating out more as a need now, \u2019celebrating weekends\u2019, enjoying expensive holidays, et al. Once when I had to request our grocer to extend the credit by a week (till we get our next paycheck), I thought that this had to stop. We, the independent, self-respecting youth could not embarrass ourselves any further. We need to immediately take control of our money, before our \u2019lifestyle\u2019 digs a hole in our future. So we, my husband and I, set a simple savings goal. We decided to put aside 10% of our salaries in a savings account\u2014 as soon as we got our paycheck \u2014and then forget about it. This was a total of Rs.10,000 between the two of us then. With the success of our savings goal, we were further motivated to treat our money well and set some more advanced financial goals. But as none of us understood much of personal finance, simplicity remained the key. We decided that we would save Rs. 1 lakh in a fixed deposit account. And any amount we can save beyond this Rs. 1 lakh, we would start investing in other investment channels. So almost a year after we started saving, we took a step ahead and invested.

Our simple investment goal* was to invest 70% of our invest-able amount in shares\u2014high risk but high gains, 10% in bonds/fixed deposits, 10% in gold/silver and 10% in real estate (this was basically the home loan installment that we owed to our bank). The savings and investment goals got us into a very healthy financial practice of wealth building. Both of us, within just a year, had got into the savings discipline and we did not do badly at investing either. Though I must admit, we had a tough time initially understanding the share markets and the entire game of investing. But after a few ups and downs, regular following of economic news, some reading and a simple course at a training institute helped us get the feel of investing the right way. My husband once jokingly said that he would like to retire from work at 40 years of age with a property worth Rs. 1crore of our own and a Rs. 1 crore net worth (all savings and investments put together). This became our retirement goal. Today, almost 20 years and two kids later, we are happy that we set those goals as we could work towards them. Now in our mid-forties, I had left a full time profession long back and my husband retired from his work to follow his passion\u2014painting\u2013 with our retirement goal more than met. Our friends, who started their married life with us and like us but without any clear goals, are still struggling to get their money equations right. Every change in their lives\u2014birth of child, education, big expenses, job shift/loss, loss in investments\u2014would disturb their money equation and they would spend substantial time in getting it right again\u2014until of course the next change hit them. I am not saying that we did everything right. But at least having a goal\u2014a target\u2014got us thinking about the direction we needed to work in.

First step in realizing any dream, financial or otherwise is to put it in writing\u2014i.e., to set a goal. Most dreams can be made achievable through a proper goal setting and planning. Financial goal setting allows you to think before hand, where you are trying to get with your finances. It can be likened with \u2014 Setting a target for your cricket match Goal setting can be likened with setting targets for your cricket match. Your dream, as a cricketer or as your cricket team\u2019s captain could be to become the greatest player/team in cricket. What will make this dream become real are the goals you set for yourself/for your team. Goals like winning matches, scoring maximum centuries, taking the highest number of wickets would make your dream look achievable. Set SMART goals Be Specific - e.g. I want to be the highest scorer of runs rather than I want to play well in today\u2019s match. E.g. I want to buy a Bajaj Pulsar bike within a year, rather than I want to own some vehicle some day. Set a Measurable goal - E.g. I want to score a century/100 runs today. E.g. I want to set aside Rs.1000 every month in my savings account, instead of wanting to save a lot of money. Set an Achievable goal - Let the goal be Realistic - E.g. If you are team\u2019s lead bowler then, \u201c I want to take at least one wicket \u201d seems to be too obvious and easy and may not motivate you enough to taste the best of your potential. \u201cI want to take all the wickets\u201d seems to be close to impossible. Hence, a goal in between\u2014maybe three wickets\u2014could be an achievable yet motivating goal. E.g. if your net earning is around Rs.10,000 a month then saving Rs.1000 is an achievable and energizing goal than a Rs.100 or a Rs. 8000 saving every month. Set a Timeline E.g. I want to play international cricket in another five years. E.g. I want to save Rs.15000 by the end of this year. I Know \u2013 About Goal Setting",

They are of the same age, went to the same school, studied at the same polytechnic, got jobs in the same company and worked there on the same level. They even had the same retirement goal\u2014both wished to retire from their jobs when they had a sum of Rs.10,00,000 in their retirement accounts. The only difference was the way they went about achieving the retirement goal. Ram started to save and invest towards his retirement goal on his 20th birthday, just a few months after he started his job. He started by putting his Diwali bonus of Rs.10,000 in a fixed deposit. He then kept on adding Rs. 10,000 a year (i.e. less than Rs.1000 a month). Whereas Sham waited till he had \u2018enough\u2019 money left to save for his goal, despite Ram\u2019s repeated advice. On his 31st birthday, Sham finally followed Ram\u2019s advice and plan, and put Rs.30,000 in a fixed deposit. By then, even Ram could contribute Rs.20,000 a year to his \u2018retirement account\u2019. Thereafter, Ram and Sham kept contributing Rs.20,000 and Rs. 30,000 a year respectively.

No matter whatever your situation is right now, you should plan to get into this green position to have the best shot at achieving financial freedom*. 2. You have more money but lesser time to accomplish your goals. Or, you have more time at hand but lesser money to reach your goal. If any of the above statements is true for you, you are in the yellow position. Achieving all your goals at a time may seem like a daunting task in either case. By giving yourself more time to achieve the goals or by increasing your income and/or reducing your expenses, you can jump to the best position\u2014green. But for the moment, you will have to make choices, prioritize the goals and go about achieving them one at a time. 3. You could be in the red position (tight position) when with lesser money on hand you must achieve your goal urgently. This could be the case if you currently have a lot of liabilities/debts and no/less savings. In such a situation, you will have to delay all your other goals for an immediate one\u2014repaying debt and building savings. This would help you to secure and stabilize your present financial position and move from the red position to either of the yellow positions.

I have joined work in the IT sector six months back and earn Rs.25,000 per month salary (i.e., about Rs.12,000 take-home after deductions). Last six months that I received my salary, I almost spent everything\u2014treating friends, buying gifts for my near and dear ones, buying myself some feel good stuff etc But my father, a bank manager, wants me to cut down on the spending and start saving. Save for what? My life looks cool now and I want to enjoy it fully. Help Me!!! Shravan calls for help Hi! 1 am a 24-year-old electrician. I earn from contract works that I take up\u2014from households, offices, farms and workshops. My income thus is not steady. Some weeks I earn a lot while others could go with hardly any work. I am the youngest of 4 siblings and live with my ageing parents and a blind elder brother. Both my sisters are married. I had taken loan from a bank for their weddings. Now most of my income is spent in funding our daily needs, health care and in repaying installments of the loan. And even if I save anything, that gets consumed in my not so good days. I am the only earning member of my family and have been feeling pressured lately. I am working overtime and thinking whether I should take up a job. I am so confused, I don\u2019t know what to do. Shravan seems to have too many goals on his mind. Can you help him write his financial goals one by one and then help him prioritize so that he feels less pressured and knows exactly where to start. Use the space below. Look for Mrs. Bharati\u2019s explanation at the end of the section.

    "text": "58 Mrs. Bharati\u2019s Common Money Sense Answers Dear Ravi, You are one of those lucky people who does not have any responsibilities and have an opportunity to start building your wealth right away. But many young people, like you, often have this attitude that they regret later because of the lost time and opportunity. In your own words, life looks cool \u2018now\u2019. What about future? You say you want to enjoy your life \u2018fully\u2019. You are just 21 now and have more than twice or thrice as much life to live. As a wise and responsible person, you should ask yourself the following questions: n Will I be earning all my life? n Will my life always look the same (as today)? n Will the outside situation (the economy, job market, etc) always improve or at least stay the same? n Today my father can still support me financially but am I ready myself for any emergency (accidents, job loss, health emergency etc)? Will I have to depend on him forever to bail me out of contingencies? The good news is that most young people grow out of this phase of \u2018why think about the future, live the moment\u2019. (Though I do agree that you should make the most of every moment and not worry about future.) I am sure that in a couple of years (or at worst 5 years), you will get an answer to your own questions. But the point is, do you want to lose those 5 years i.e., 60 months of income\u2014and as many months of a missed opportunity to build your wealth. Imagine if you save Rs.2,000 a month (i.e. Rs. 24000 a year) in a fixed deposit, you can expect to have a balance of about Rs. 1.5 lakh by then(@6% interest*) If you still have a question on why a young person of your age should save, I have only one answer. It is actually important only for people your age to save. People my age (past 40s) may just have 10 more years of responsibilities. Whether we cruised through effortlessly or struggled our way till this age, we have managed to get past most of our responsibilities like: 1. Higher education. 2. Marriage. * Discover the power of compounding on page 138 of the book.",

    "text": "60 Dear Shravan, It is good to see you standing by your family and shouldering the responsibilities. But you seem to be having too many things on your mind, financially. I would suggest you a 3-step approach to get out of this confusion: 1. Pen the things on your mind in the form of precise goals. 2. Prioritize them based on urgency and cost of each goal. 3. Go one-by-one\u2014achieving one goal at a time. The 3 main goals that I can see from your letter are\u2014loan repayment, improving and stabilizing household income and building reserves (savings). According to me, they should be prioritized in the order mentioned. Loan repayment should be your biggest priority as it is your debt\u2014a commitment to external agency and also a very costly one. If you delay repaying your loan, it will add interest and increase the amount you would need to payback\u2014further increasing your tensions. You will have to figure out a smart way to meet this goal, but this should be the immediate goal. Stabilizing your household income would be another important goal as unless you have a steady flow of money, you cannot plan well. When you specify a goal accurately, you can work on it effectively. Like in your case, you are just looking at your own income; why not think about \u2018household\u2019 income? This way you can look at the other members of your household contributing to the income in some way. Building reserves is a very important goal as it can act as a shock absorber and can smoothen your financial situation over a period of time. But Shravan, in your case, this can wait till you have achieved the first two goals as they are more urgent. Once you list the exact goals and prioritize them, things would start seeming simpler and achievable to you. Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

Had it not been for your goal number 5\u2014repaying credit card debt\u2014your work could have passed as a remarkable effort. But with Rs.25000 debt on your credit card, you should not be thinking about any other goal just yet. Your most urgent goal and the only one till you achieve it, must be to pay back your debt. Credit card companies charge late fees and heavy interests on a monthly basis on the payments due from you. If you do not timely repay the total amount due, you may end up paying twice or thrice the amount you borrowed within few months. So think about it seriously. And add another goal to your list: Always make timely and full payments due on the credit card Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati Key Points\u2014ICanDo Financial Goal Setting 1. Goal setting is crucial for effective financial planning. 2. Set simple, measurable goals. 3. Set a realistic timeline for the goal. 4.

No one in the class got birthday invitations from all classmates. But I did. My birthday was attended by everyone I invited. I loved all the importance I was getting. I loved to act pricey at times. I thought I was very popular in school. Then we advanced to a different secondary school. And everything changed. I was just another girl in the class. No special favors, no privileges. I was disheartened when no one turned up for my birthday party that year. All my classmates went for another boy\u2018s birthday that fell on the same day as mine. I cried badly that day. I would have been 10-11 years old. I complained to my parents about this behavior of my so-called friends. And I still remember what my father said in response. He said, \u2018you did not invest in your friendship\u2019. That was the first time I heard the word - \u2018invest\u2019. I didn\u2019t make much sense of it then. But my parents later explained that the favors in primary school came to me because my mother was our school principal. And even though I had this privilege and everyone\u2019s attention early on, I did not capitalize on it. I had a plenty of friends then, but I did not \u2018invest\u2019 in their friendship. Instead, I sort of misused the privilege. I took it for granted. I believed that it would remain forever. I acted pricey, poked fun at others and took undue advantage of the \u2018friendships\u2019. The incidence lasted in my memory not as much for the embarrassment it created on my birthday, as for the lessons I learnt; \u2018You need to \u2018invest\u2019 to be able to enjoy continued privileges.\u2019 \u2018Good times do not last forever.\u2019 \u2018You are in better position to invest in good times, but you make the best investment efforts in your bad times.\u2019 The last lesson has its roots in the efforts I put in later to become a good friend and build my friends\u2019 trust in me.

The real need of understanding investing in its truest and fullest best was after my marriage when we, as a couple started taking our finances seriously. We met our savings goal and were ready to start investing, but hardly had any clear idea of investments then. We were confused between investing and saving and even investing and insurance. Back in those days (almost 20 years back) information was not so readily available. Media was not much evolved, there was no internet and banks never had a concept of formally educating customers. Only your bank officer friends and insurance agents were your sources of some information. The stock market stories that went out of the broker community were more about losses or unrealistic profits than those about smart investment strategies.

    "text": "64 Surprisingly, the most helpful investment learning I received was from a dietician friend of mine. Anu was my college friend who pursued profession as a dietician. She married Raj, a professor of commerce when she was just 20 years of age. They had a humble household income, almost half of ours. But they lived our equivalent lifestyle (theirs was better, they worked 9 to 5 while we slogged longer). The secret was their investments. The commerce professor\u2014dietician duo had got their investment equation right and in Anu\u2019s words, put their money to work too. Between the 3 of them i.e. the husband \u2013wife and their money, they made earnings as much as us. We decided to make Anu and Raj our investment gurus (at least to begin with). Anu, a dietician by passion had a very interesting analogy for investing, which anyone could relate to. She compared investing with cooking. According to her, human beings should eat a balanced diet customized to individual nutrient needs, right from childhood. The nutritional needs in the childhood are very different from that of working adults which are also different for the elderly. Similarly, when young, your money needs \u2019growth\u2019 aiding (nutrients) returns from investments. As it grows up with age and lifecycle stage, it would need a balance between growth and steady income investments. And as it matures, with you (around retirement), you\u2019d need to give it a steady income first and then growth opportunities. As you may not get all the required nourishment from a single food group, you\u2019ll have to include in your menu, items from various food groups. Just the same, you\u2019d do in case of investment. You\u2019d create a \u2018portfolio\u2019 of investment that has items from different asset classes (like food groups) that can together give your money the nourishment it needs. I was amazed at the similarity. Then Raj further explained the various investment channels and the kind of returns I could expect. Equity or stock related investments (shares or equity mutual funds) provide growth, while debt investments (FDs, Bonds, Debt mutual funds) offer a steady income potential. Investments in items of value (like gold, land, commodities), would provide my money security as they would inflationproof my money to a large extent and also have growth potential. For beginners like me, he had a simple thumb rule for creating a balanced investment portfolio based on our age.",

For beginners like me, he had a simple thumb rule for creating a balanced investment portfolio based on our age. Raj said that the equity component in my portfolio should not exceed (100 minus my age)% of my total investments. So for me (at 28 years), the rule guides that if my portfolio has equity in excess of 72%, then it needs to be balanced so as not to be risky. I can balance it by increasing my debt investment or decreasing (by selling some shares/mutual fund units) equity component. I started with that guideline, and believe me this simple thumb rule is proving effective even now (at 43). It\u2019s a long way I\u2019ve come from that and have devised many a investing thumb rules for myself . But so effective is this \u2018balancing the portfolio\u2019 thumb rule that I have been practicing and sharing it with everyone\u2014beginners or experts alike. Whoever said that investing is complicated and difficult! I\u2019ve begun to believe that it\u2019s as simple and as creative as cooking a balanced meal. What you need is some knowledge about the food groups (asset classes), some idea about the nutrients (risks and returns) and a good understanding about your nutritional needs (your investment needs). If you have this right, you are ready to dish out an investment portfolio. And while balancing risks, you can be creative with your investment portfolio and learn on the way. You may want to refer to experts and recipes too. Your search for that \u2018ideal\u2019 portfolio for you, may soon be over.",

    "text": "65 I Know \u2013 About Investing Investment is that activity in financial planning, which can directly help you meet your goals. Yet no other concept in personal finance is so widely misunderstood (if not ignored) as investment. The idea behind investing your money is to put it to use in such a way that it is likely to earn more money. This happens because someone is willing to pay you interest in lieu of using your money as in the case of fixed or recurring deposits, bonds. Or because the business in which you invested your money (by buying shares) is making profits. Or the value of assets like gold, land etc. increased after you bought them. Thus, investing can be thought of as a way to make your money work for you. Why invest? 1. To stay ahead of inflation. Investing ensures that the purchasing power of your money is not just restored but it improves year after year. 2. To meet your financial goals. Invest allows you to build wealth by making your money earn steady returns and grow over a period of time. Inflation is a rise in general levels of price of everyday goods, over a period of time. It means that you can buy less with the same amount of money from one year to the next. Due to inflation, a steady income alone is not enough to help you reach your financial goals. Box 3A\u2014Note that 1. Investing is different from saving. 2. Investing is not gambling. 3. Investing is only as risky as you want it to be for you! 4. Investing is not a get-rich-quick formula! 5.

Risks and returns in investment can very easily be likened to taste and nutrition in cooking. Saving alone cannot give you the kind of returns that investing can. Also, returns cannot come alone; risks and returns in investing come in a package. Investing involves some risks. But remember that investing is only as risky as you want it to be for you. Before beginning to invest you should really need to answer a few questions to check your risk tolerance. Questions like\u2014how comfortable you would be: a. If your investment changes in value every day. b. To see your investment decreasing at times. c. If your funds are locked for a certain period and you may not get them exactly when you want. Check out the risks you may face while investing in different types of investment channels and the returns you can expect from these investments, in the next few pages. The process of investment revolves around RISK and RETURNS. It starts with understanding your risk profile and the returns you expect to get from your investment. It proceeds with using your knowledge of risks and returns of various investment channels. In general, investments with higher risks also stand to earn higher returns, but those returns are not guaranteed. The aim should be working towards balancing risks and returns\u2014taking measured risks and expecting realistic returns.",

The options are so vast that it might get even an expert investor confused. The following chart should make it simpler for you to understand the various channels. It explains four basic ways you can invest your money, and how they are placed in the context of risks and returns. High-risk, high-return channels are growth channels that help you build wealth by enabling your invested money grow significantly over a long-term Low-risk, low-returns investments generally assure steady but smaller returns, helping you build wealth slowly but steadily. Commodities like gold, silver or even land are traditionally known to rise in value along with inflation and hence secure your purchasing power despite inflation.

But each one would fall in at least one of three basic categories of investment mentioned below. You mostly invest your money, by: 1. Lending it If you lend your investable money to government, banks or businesses by buying their bonds or opening a fixed/recurring deposit account, these organizations will pay you interest for allowing them to use your money. Your money thus can earn steady returns by way of interest. 2. Buying share in business capital and profits By buying share in profitable businesses, your investment can grow in two ways: a. The company may pay you a dividend \u2014your share of profit b. The shares of the company may increase in value. 3. Buying an item of value You can buy things that may increase in market value, such as gold, land, house or collectibles like a piece of art or even stamps. You can make money by selling the asset for more than what you paid for. Although not an investment channel, starting your own business may well be considered as an investment option. If you have the aptitude and necessary skill/talent along with a profitable business idea and a huge risk taking capacity, you may want to consider this as an option.",

    "text": "78 The key to any good investment strategy is to balance the risks and returns\u2014minimize the risks and maximize the returns, to a possible extent. This is possible through what is known as diversification of your investment portfolio. It may seem to be a very complex thing. But simply put, it says \u2018do not put all the eggs in one basket\u2019. Step 4 \u2013 Designing your Investment Portfolio Diversification allows you to even out the risks of investing. To start with, if you have lesser funds for investing, it would make sense to stick to just one or two types of investments. But as you go on building the portfolio, it is important to diversify. A well-diversified portfolio is like a balanced whole meal. It should constitute investments in different channels to serve the 3 main investment needs: 1. Securing the purchasing power of your money over a long term. Invest in\u2014Gold, silver, land. Largely known to counter inflation, these assets can even appreciate significantly and give bigger gains in long term. 2. Earning steady returns with a practically no (or low) risk to the invested money. Invest in\u2014FD/RD (deposits), bonds, post office savings schemes, debt mutual fund. 3. Allowing your money to grow by taking some measured risks. Invest in\u2014Shares, equity mutual fund. The proportion of each would depend on your risk tolerance and the time/stage at which you start investing (i.e., with the time you have with you to stay invested) For older people, such as retirees, bonds/deposits are an important type of investment because they give steady, assured returns at a higher rate than savings accounts. But for long-term younger investors, \u2018growing money\u2019 to have a wealthier future may make more sense. Therefore, a smaller portion of investments earning steady returns and a bigger portion of the ones that would help you \u2018grow your money\u2019, is advisable early in life, with the balance gradually switching as you reach retirement.",

Calculate the amount invested for only such number of shares. E.g., if you bought 100 shares of ABC Co., but sold only 50 during the review period, then calculate only for 50 shares. 2. To correctly determine profit/loss for shares of the same company bought and sold at different times or prices, use the \u2018FIFO\u2014First In, First Out\u2019 rule. Consider the dates and prices of the shares purchased first in your sequence of transactions and move one by one. E.g. in the above example, if the 100 shares you have bought at different times, say; 40 shares @ Rs. 12 on April 1, and 60 shares @ Rs. 11 on April 10 and sold 50 shares @ Rs. 15 on October 31, then entry into your worksheet columns should look as the one shown below. You may want to use separate columns for the same stock bought/sold on different dates/prices for simplicity of calculations. 3. You may want to add all the fees and taxes you paid while buying the shares to your amount invested. Similarly subtract the fees and taxes from the amount recovered while selling those shares. 4. Note that the % returns are for that period of time during which you are holding those shares. In the above example it is 27.11% for the 7 months between purchase and sale. No. 1. Stockname ABC Co. No. of shares sold 50 Sale date 31/10/09 Sale rate Rs.15 Amount recovered Rs.750 Purchase date/s 1/4/09, 10/4/09 Purchase cost/s 40@ Rs.12; 10@ Rs.11 Amount Invested Rs.590 Profit/Loss Rs. 160 % Returns 27.11%",

But I do not know how to start, as I do not have any source of income. I am a full time student and get a pocket money of Rs.1000 a month from my parents for my needs. Most of this money is used for petrol in my scooty, eating out in college canteen, an occasional new dress, some books/CDs and beauty care. My fees and college books get funded by my parents separately. I seriously wish to invest, but does not know how and when I can. Should I borrow some money and start investing? Saurav says I am not too good with numbers. And investment seems to be a numbers game. Complex formulae, a lot of numbers, difficult terminology and my hard-earned real money put together scare me. And I do not know whether I will ever understand investing my money. I am a very cautious 25-year- old artist. I simply understand those schemes that say your money would double in so many years. I have put my money in my bank account which offers an auto fixed-deposit of amount in my savings account over Rs.5000. It guarantees that my savings would double in 8 years. I am weary to try anything new in investing. But I also feel that I could be left out of something very life changing. Do you think Asma can invest now? Write your thoughts in the space below.

    "text": "90 Dear Asma, You are only 19, a student and thinking about investment. Good thinking lady! If you indeed start investing today, you have up to 40 years of productive life on your side to invest. I cannot imagine the amount of wealth you would build by investing for 40 years. Time is on your side. Now get the money too! How? Firstly, you are above 18 years of age, so you can independently manage all your investments. Consider this, you get Rs.1,000 allowance for your \u2018wants\u2019 (not all that you spend on are your needs). Now if you can find say Rs.500 (to start with) from that money\u2014in a month or two or three, you can get going. Of course you would need a savings bank account to start with. If you do not have one in your name, then open one right away. Assuming you have a bank account, then your investment options with a starting sum of Rs.500 are listed below: 1. 50 units of a newly launched mutual fund from any reputed asset management company. Through a systematic investment plan (SIP) you can keep investing every month. 2. Demat account and at least 1 share of a well known \u2018A\u2019 list company (Yes you can buy a single share at a time. Then you can build more as you earn more) 3. Recurring deposit account (it earns more interest than a normal savings account) that allows you to invest amount as low as Rs.50 every month. Should you borrow to invest? The answer is\u2014NO. Never invest money that is not yours and investable. Now the question remains how to find that Rs.500. You will have to figure that out. But if you ask my personal opinion, for a cause as good and great as investment, it makes sense to cut down your expenses from eating out, buying a new dress every month or even beauty care.

    "text": "91 Dear Saurav, Investment is a science and an art. Since you are an artist, at least the art part of it should not be difficult for you. On a more serious note, I do not know whether to call investing as something life changing (though for some it has proved to be just that). But in general, investing is definitely an empowering process. It enables you to plan for your entire life well ahead in time. Thus, you can maintain your lifestyle (if not steadily improving) during those times of your life also when you would not be earning. It will certainly be helpful in those times also when your income alone proves incapable of supporting you. Coming to your question, the numbers should not put you off from the process that is so not just about them. Investment, as I keep saying, is mainly about understanding your needs first and finding an external offering (an investment channel) that can help you meet those needs. Numbers and formulae form a small part of this process. Many institutions that sell investment products, these days have their communication simplified for even a less educated to make sense. Or there are those friendly and so-ready- to-help customer service executives at banks who can help you with this. If you can use internet, log onto a search engine and you will find thousands of websites that have calculator programs. These would require you to key in some very basic information but help you with answers to most financial planning problems using math formulae. You say you understand only doubling the money proposition. Now let me teach you a trick by which you can know when your money would double, if you know the rate of returns on an investment or vice versa. It is called the Rule of 72 (see box). Is not that simple? Many such tricks are also available on the net. Check out the list of resources mentioned in the end of the book Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

    "text": "93 Dear Digen, Congratulations! You are happy with your money management skills and also have Rs.9000 as investable money within just 2 months of your employment. If you seriously want my advice on investing in stock market, it would be that you should not invest in stocks right now. And the reason to this has nothing to do with the state of stock markets right now. But it has got to do with you and your ignorance of stock market investing. My explanation to this curt advice to you would be in 2 parts: 1. You seem to be so dazzled by your friend\u2019s \u2018huge profits\u2019 that you are not using your mind. If you put your money, while in such bewilderment, it would be injurious not just to your financial health but also to your mental peace. Just use your conscience and think. If making huge profits on stock market was as simple as I knowing and recommending you a stock to invest in, then will I myself (or for that matter any stock market expert) not be minting money? Your intent of investing in stock market is good but the premise is wrong. If you read this section and work the worksheets provided sincerely, you would notice that the only premise for investing in any channel (including stocks or shares) should be your investment need. You can be inspired to invest by someone or some thing. But when you take the investment decision\u2014how much should I invest and what should comprise my investment portfolio\u2014that should be based solely on your investment objective. 2. Besides, when you decide to invest your money, you should have a fair amount of knowledge of the channel you are investing in. What are the risks involved and whether the returns are guaranteed or steady? You do not seem to have gathered any such understanding of stock market investing yet. Firstly, your friend is not \u2018investing\u2019 but he is \u2018trading\u2019 on the stock market. While trading stocks, he is only relying on price fluctuations on the stock exchange that day, not so much on the quality of the stock or company. Whereas investing in a stock involves longer term intent to hold the shares of the company. You know your friend has recently made profits. It could be interesting for you to know how many percentage times he has lost money while trading. I",

Having said all this Digen, I must add that you have been wise enough not to just jump into investing. Also, that you are not the only one. Many stock market investors invest on wrong premise and assumptions. Then they get their fingers burnt. Hence, most investors are not able to make the best of investing in shares. It has a huge potential to profit its investors in the long run. But it is in the investors\u2019 hands to prepare themselves to earn what the investments are ready to offer. Be wise.

I cannot recall anyone in my generation having any debt related problem in youth. The credit for this, I must admit, did not go to us as much as to the regulations and policies regarding sanctioning loans. The only problem with debt we had then was that it was so inaccessible. My brother had applied for a loan to buy a piece of land. The loan was not more than a lakh of rupees. But he had to go through a very lengthy process of application. Banks required him to provide a bunch of documents as proofs\u2014of his identity, address, employment, income, even expenses, savings and investments. Some lending agencies also demanded a declaration of why this need (land purchase) was so important to him and how he was justified in asking for this loan. And to make it more difficult, the loan application, in order to be processed further, needed him to present a guarantor. (A guarantor was generally a well-placed individual earning more than the loan applicant who could guarantee the bank the applicant\u2019s income-generating ability and also take the responsibility of loan repayment if the applicant failed to.) I thought it was ridiculous\u2014so much of red tape! My brother and I (young blood) also had a heated discussion on how a young person can dream big in this country? Why don\u2019t they (the lending agencies) trust us? Why do we have to justify our need? And are we not wise enough to make the decision (about our need and ability to repay the loan) ourselves? Both of us laugh at it, when we talk of it now. Today\u2019s loan market is exactly what my brother and I wished for the wise and ambitious young people. Loans are widely accessible. The application process is simple. In fact, the lending agencies are queuing up to lend you some money. (I often get a crossed cheque in my mail box from my bank as a personal loan! And I had never asked for it!) You can take as much loan as possible, and the next lender you go to will not blink an eyelid before sanctioning you yet another loan. So, are my brother and I happy for the youth today? Yes and No!",

So, are my brother and I happy for the youth today? Yes and No! Yes, because there are limitless opportunities to dream and act to achieve the dream. No matter how much you earn now, if you are confident of your potential, you can borrow your future income today. And you do not have to spend days and months collecting documents for applying for a loan. Neither do you need to wait for months to hear from your bank about your loan application. That is really great! What is depressing though, is to see that various other debt related problems (and of humungous scale) have emerged due to this one convenience of wide accessibility of loans. The recent economic downturn has showed us all what damage debt has caused all around the world. Debts are not just pulling down individuals, they are crashing on big international companies as well, leaving thousands unemployed and without any financial support. My brother today owns a call center. And guess what business he is into? Debt collection! On behalf of their clients (credit card companies), they call up people with credit card debt to remind them of their debt repayment schedules and \u2018advise\u2019 them of the consequences if they do not pay on time. The stories he has to tell about loans and debts today are of different kinds. Read these: 1. Credit card debt is emerging as the single largest cause of financial problems across the world. 2. Many credit card users do not know how much interest they are charged on their credit card debt.",

My experience with people I have come across reveals some interesting differences in attitude towards debt of people in different age groups. 1. Most seniors (45 years and beyond), who have been used to the \u2018loans on ration and regulation\u2019 are careful about raising debt even today and particular about paying it back. This is the group that uses credit cards prudently\u2014not letting a lot of debt mount up on the card. 2. Majority of the youth (25 \u201335 years of age) have home loans, vehicle loans, multiple credit cards, durables like TV, PC and even holidays and travel bought on EMIs (equated monthly installments). 3. Some younger people (below 25 years of age) have access to credit cards and many have an education loan to repay before even they start earning. 4. Young persons generally have more number of credit cards. Seniors have more credit limit on a single card. 5. Youth are quite liberal in using credit cards for online payments, seniors are skeptical. Banks and lending agencies have loosened the strings. Credit cards have put the money we do not have now, in our pockets, although temporarily. The deregulation has put the onus of judging our loan repayment capacity and validating the need to seek loans, on us. It is almost like we have every power, everything financially working for us, but ourselves. It is wiser to learn from those who have made mistakes, than making mistakes ourselves and paying a heavy price for learning a lesson. External controls, whether in the form of parents or bankers\u2019 strict policies, always leave no choice but to follow the rules and good practices. It is time we get our internal controls\u2014our own financial wisdom in place while using debt. Effectively, we can get the best of both the worlds\u2014the open world full of choices and opportunities and the regulated world that ensures good repayment practices.",

A loan is an arrangement with a bank or other lending agency. In this arrangement, you get a lump sum of money from the lending agency on a promise to pay it back with interest within a given time. The repayment could either be in several installments, or in one payment at the end, depending on the design of the loan. By taking a loan, you create a debt . Debt is that which is owed. But many times in personal finance, the words \u2018consumer loans\u2019 and \u2018debt\u2019 are used interchangeably. Credit is a lending agency\u2019s belief or confidence in your repayment abilities and intent. Based on this, a lending agency\u2014be it a bank or any other, will decide whether to sanction you a loan and how much. There are many specific kinds of loans; the most common being taken for housing (purchase, construction or repairs), purchase of a vehicle, education, farming or entrepreneurial schemes. You may also find loans that can get you out of a personal emergency, unforeseen medical expense, or can help you fund a big purchase or wedding/festival celebrations. If this is the case, however, make sure you have a plan to pay it back, as these expenses will not grow your money and you will need to make arrangements to repay them from your other sources of income.",

    "text": "105 I Know \u2013 Things to consider before taking loans 1. Interest Rate: Interest is the fee paid to the lender on borrowed money. For loans, the interest rate will tell you how much more than the original loan amount you will have to pay back. In general, interest rates are fixed for a length of time (the life of a loan, for example). But as the markets change, so do the interest rates. It is important to understand if the interest rates that apply to your accounts are fixed (one rate throughout the loan tenure) or floating (variable interest rate that changes according to market changes). Usually, even the fixed rate loans have a re-set clause to be applied after some years. 2. Loan tenure/Repayment pattern and Instalment amount: Knowledge of all the three will give you an idea of i) The number of months/years you will take to repay the loan in full. ii) What amount you would be required to pay at a time, and iii) Whether you need to pay it on a monthly/quarterly/half-yearly/yearly basis. This information will help you plan your finances better and also to check whether you are borrowing as per your expected future income or are going beyond it. 3. Other charges and penalties: Banks and other lending institutions generally charge a nominal one time processing fee and a service tax. Also, if you fail to pay any installment on time they may charge you a penalty for late payment. It would be wise to know these and other charges (if any) before hand, to avoid any shocks or surprises later. 4. Foreclosure or pre-closure charges: You may wish to resort to foreclosure to avail loans at lower interest rate from some other bank. Lending agencies generally penalize pre-closure of loans or ending the loan agreement before its earlier agreed term. Foreclosure charges are generally applicable on your outstanding loan amount and may be around 2-3%. Similarly, some lenders may have pre-payment charges that are applicable if you decide to prepay the loan\u2019s entire amount at any time during the term.",

I am married and we are expecting our first child in 3 months. I feel we are deep in debt. My wife (a secretary) and I had both taken housing loans from our companies 3 years back. With my wife on a maternity break from work, I am the single earner now. Most of my salary goes in repaying our 2 credit card bills, a housing loan and a vehicle loan. I am thinking of taking a personal loan to be able to manage our increasing expenses with a baby coming. Jassi says I am a 25-year-old HR professional. I take home a net salary of Rs.35,000 every month. I have been using 3 credit cards since I was in business school. Now I have a total credit card debt of about Rs.75,000. I also am yet to repay a part of educational loan, which comes to Rs.6,000 per month. My home loan installment gets deducted from my salary before I get it. I had borrowed Rs. 3 lakhs from my father to fund the initial payment. I have also borrowed Rs.25000 from a friend to pay my credit card bill last month. I am finding it increasingly difficult to find money to pay my debts and manage my expenses. How can I get out of this? If Rahul had approached you, what would be your advice to him?

    "text": "109 Mrs. Bharati\u2019s Common Money Sense Answers to the cases Dear Rahul, It is good to know that you are foreseeing change in your financial life with the change in your family. There are indeed a lot of changes occurring in your financial life and it is wise to note them. Your household expenses are only expected to increase from here and your family income has come down (may be temporarily) with your wife not earning anymore. What is possibly not changing right now is on the debt side. And believe me, if you at all want to change this side too, it better be by lowering that obligation and NOT increasing it further. I will advice you not to take any personal loans now. You do not want to put yourself and your family at this stage in any further debt. By doing so, you would be making your family vulnerable to financial risks. Besides that, personal loans are high interest loans. Taking a loan now, would help you in the immediate short term. But it would add to your regular monthly outflows over a long term. And mind you, your expenses are only going to increase in future\u2014child birth, education, health care. You do not want to be restricted by your debt obligations in future. You will have to manage your money well. You will have to find money to meet your future expenses. And you have 3 months to do just that. My advice for these 3 months, considering your current situation would be to build up your savings. The steps to build up your savings are given below; 1. Do away with your credit cards\u2014you do not need them now. Credit cards often make you spend the money you do not have now. But you do have to pay the bills later. If you use cash instead of credit cards, you would always question the need of the expense before actually spending your money. 2. Make a budget and stick to it. (Refer to Section 1 for details.) Reduce your expenses as much as you can and start saving. 3. Manage your debt well. See if you can get a lower interest rate or a smaller installment amount on your loans. Talk to your bank about this. Check other options available in the market. By doing so you would be reducing your monthly installment and spreading",

Keep saving with increased income. Continue to build your savings with every increase in income\u2014your increment, wife contributing to income, your investments yielding returns\u2014or reducing expenses. This way you would be able to give a debt free and stable financial future to your child. Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

    "text": "110 Dear Jassi, I am glad that you know how much debt you currently owe. It\u2019s indeed good that you have been able to put specific figures to all your debt obligations. Though the debt itself does not speak well of your current financial state. But understanding your financial position in itself is a big step in financial planning. Now let me get down to answering your question one thing at a time. Firstly, you do not need 3 credit cards. In fact you do not need any credit card right now. So stop using them first. Next, repay the Rs.75,000 due on the credit cards. That is the first debt you should pay off as it is a very costly one. Check with the bank that gave you the educational loan if you can defer the payment installments for 5-6 months. Now, going by your salary and by minimizing your expenses, you should be able to pay off the credit card debt in 5-6 month\u2019s time. Meanwhile, talk to your friend who lent you money to repay your credit card bills and your dad about your intent to pay their debt, although you are at present getting out of your other debts first. I am of course assuming that these loans to you were more of goodwill, and were interest free. Once you are out of the credit card mess, start repaying your student loan. Maintain your expenses to the minimum and pay your friend who saved you in need, may be with a small gift. And keep following this until you have given your dad his money back. Only after this last commitment can you call the money you have your own. And of course, do not resort to any further debt during this whole process. Even in future, if you wish to take a loan, follow the planning and managing debt questionnaire to be in the positive debt cycle. Best wishes, Mrs. Bharati",

It did not seem like it would rain that day. I had my final interview with the Production Head of a TV Channel at 11 a.m. I was all set to reach at least half an hour early, but suddenly it started raining cats and dogs and there was utter chaos on the road. By the time our bus had reached my stop, it was already 10:45 and it was still raining, though not that heavily. I did not have an umbrella, the office was a good 10 minutes walk (something that had seemed to be a \u2019just\u2019 10 minutes walk earlier), it was still drizzling, there was no taxi or rickshaw visible and I had just 15 minutes to get into the interview room from where I was. There was nothing that I could do but pray. And had this been some film situation, I am sure my prayers would have been answered. The rains would have stopped and a bright sun would have been out in a moment as if it was always there. Or a good-looking hero, with an umbrella and a kind heart would have bailed me out. If nothing else a superman could have surely come to my rescue. But it was not to be. And that was the reality of \u2018life\u2019, at least my life then. All the odds that moment seemed against me and I was left in a totally confused state of mind. What do I do next? Will I make it on time and in a presentable situation? How do I not get wet in this rain and still reach the office on time? Why did I not carry an umbrella? Why did I not have a back-up plan? How could I let such an important interview go by, without giving my best shot? There were just two options in front of me: a. wait, either for a rickshaw/taxi or for the rain to stop and reach late with an apology, or b. start walking, overlook the rains, reach on time, though wet. Both seemed equally scary. Why did I not carry a simple umbrella? Or at least why did I not take a taxi right from my home till the office? These were the",

There were so many other interviewees who reached well ahead of time and in their most well-groomed way. Why not me? The answer is simple, as I look at it now\u201425 years and a million experiences later; I was not prepared for surprises. I had believed that everything will be just how I expected it to be \u2014 normal. I had overlooked the probable risks on the way to such an important event and hence, had no plan to manage them. I failed the interview, even before I appeared for it. Call it my negligence or my overconfidence, but a seemingly insignificant risk cost me a big opportunity. I learnt a valuable lesson though; \u2018it is better to be safe than sorry.\u2019 Carrying an umbrella did seem an \u2018uncool\u2019 idea, but it would have been better than reaching wet for an interview. Taking a taxi would have cost me more money, but that cost would have been far lower than the cost I finally paid\u2014a lost chance.

I was practising financial risk management from the beginning of my financial planning exercise. After all I had learnt the \u2019be safe\u2019 lesson in life the hard way. I would always keep an envelope with some cash in my locker, you know \u2019just in case\u2019. I had a savings account in my son\u2019s name which had some money that was not to be touched, until an emergency struck. Though, I learned about the formal practice of maintaining an emergency fund many years later. Of course, insurance just happened. Vehicles came with a compulsory insurance in tow. And my husband\u2019s aunt was a life insurance agent. So thanks to social obligation, both my husband and I had to draw an insurance policy from her, for an amount she suggested. It was only much later did I know that a life insurance cover for me is okay but not necessary, since I am not the main earner for the family. Or that there is a guideline to know how much insurance cover you need. But if I were to point one financial risk management strategy that is a star in my kitty of strategies, then it has to be \u2018the umbrella and the taxi\u2019 strategy. I mean, it may not be cool to have just one credit card and still at times pay by cash. But it still is much cooler than running from friends to family to manage to pay the mounting credit card bills. It might not be cool to spend time on managing your money\u2014the income and expenses and to live within means, especially in this world of plastic money. But it is coolest to know that your financial practices today are going to get your family a better life with every passing year and not make it vulnerable to financial risks. An insurance premium might cost some money, but it is certainly worth it, considering that it gets us peace of mind thinking that in case something happens, there is a partner who can share the financial burden.

The degree of risk will differ from individual to individual and from situation to situation. Take again the example of rains and umbrella.

Also if you have that \u2018devil may care\u2019 attitude, you may take getting wet in your stride and still present yourself smartly for a formal meeting or an interview.

While some households manage big expenses like child\u2019s marriage fairly effortlessly, there are examples of some other households that are thrown in lifetime of debt and poverty cycles because of this one expense. Vulnerability defines how weak or susceptible you are to risks. It is your ability (or inability) to cope with risks, to prepare for and protect against or recover from losses. Poor households with uncertain, irregular income are more vulnerable to risks. But vulnerability is also determined by your money management practices and actions. Some practices increase vulnerability, while some help reduce vulnerability. Whether with uncertain/irregular income or not, it makes sense to be aware of these practices, so that you can reduce your vulnerability to risks as much as possible through wise financial practices.

    "text": "118 I Know \u2013 About Financial Risks We face various kinds of financial risks, which may or may not realize during our life cycle. But this does not mean we can overlook them. The first step to managing a risk is being aware of it. Some common financial risks are mentioned below. 1. Risk to Income: A dependable source of income can be considered to be the first step towards a secured financial living. A risk of income loss, if realized, can throw all your financial planning off gear. 2. Risk to Expenses: Expenses, if managed properly, leave scope for saving and wealth building through investments. But expenses going beyond the means, lead to a highly unstable financial state that could lead to risks to assets and debt. 3. Risks to Assets: Cash assets like savings help deal with expenses and emergencies. Investment assets help money grow and store the value of money by beating inflation. Vehicles, equipments, computers etc., are assets that, besides having monetary value, are worth more for their function. Life cycle needs if not planned for and managed properly tend to eat into these assets. Hence, the risk to expenses, if not managed, will soon aggravate the risk to assets. With assets depleting, it would reduce the cushion that guards your finances, making you vulnerable to further financial risks. 4. Risks to Debt: Income generating or asset-creating loans (business, buying home/vehicle) get repaid from the income generated through the asset or savings made possible due to the asset. But credit card debt and personal loans need to be repaid through some other sources of income. Life cycle needs and emergencies if not planned for may force you into rushing unprepared and unplanned for debts on any terms. With such debts come pressures to pay them back, along with the high interest amounts. Choice of the source of loans can also pose a risk to debt. If the lender is not a legal, authorized entity then you are most likely to be at a risk of costlier loans\u2014higher rate of interest, fixed interest or more frequent interest and even frauds/cheating.",

Possibility or chance of a risk realizing and the magnitude of loss it can cause, determine if a risk is high or low.

With such debts come pressures to pay them back, along with the high interest amounts. This generally should ring an alarm bell\u2014a warning signal that your finances are not in control and your financial well being is in danger. Other likely risk to debt\u2014almost a consequence of unplanned borrowing and/or wrong money management practices\u2014is default or inability to repay debts on time. This leads to a vicious cycle of higher interest rate or loss of collateral, increased debt, loss of assets, no further savings or assets and thus further vulnerability to financial risks. Choice of source of loans can also pose a risk to debt. If the lender is not a legal, authorized entity, then you are most likely at a risk of costlier loans\u2014higher rate of interest, fixed interest or more frequent interest and frauds/cheating. Avoiding such a costly risk or reducing it are the only two ways to manage risk to debts. Avoid Risk Avoid taking personal loans - for consumption purposes. Instead plan and insure/ save for them Pay loan installments and credit card bills in full and on time Deal with only legal lending institutions. Do not sign any document/ blank paper without reading and understanding contents/ terms. Understand the lending terms before hand and check if they suit your plans.

It is a good way to reduce your risk to income; loss in income or a sudden dip. How much to save for a \u2018rainy day\u2019? It is generally recommended to maintain an emergency fund that can cover your living expenses for at least three months. But if your job is less secure or you run a business or are self-employed, then you probably should save to cover your expenses for six months or more. Where to save? Money in the emergency fund should be kept in a savings account\u2014separate from your other savings accounts\u2014that is easily accessible. You should ideally fund your emergency account before any of your other savings accounts. If you do not have the money right now to fund an entire emergency fund, start small but immediately. Save a little bit from each paycheck, until you have built up the required savings. In the meantime, also try to cut back on some other unnecessary spending to help save faster. Build an emergency fund in 3 easy steps: 1. Open a separate savings bank account, 2. Maintain a balance to cover at least 3 months of your living expenses, 3.

But in case of disasters that strike once in a while\u2014fire, death, accidents, huge commercial losses\u2014financial losses can be much beyond means. These can wipe out wealth and financial plans in a moment and lead to further suffering. Often when a disaster strikes or any unexpected, unpleasant event occurs, there would always be a few friends you can rely on, who would stand by you in your trying times and help you stand up again. They could be your family, close friends, relatives, neighbors, members of community. One such friend who can help you avoid hardships during an emergency and share your financial burden is Insurance . What is insurance? Insurance is a channel to transfer risk when the chances of a risk realizing are low, but if the event occurs then the heavy cost of loss can set you back substantially. Insurance allows you to transfer the risk of a potential loss, from you to the insurance company, in exchange for a fee or premium. The premium or the fee is a relatively fixed and affordable amount that you pay periodically (generally once a year) to be covered against a highly uncertain and potentially catastrophic loss. By setting this amount aside (in an insurance policy) you are actually reducing the uncertainty of a probable financial disaster. Knowing that should a loss occur, it would be fully or partially covered by insurance, you are actually buying yourself and your family, peace of mind. No matter how well you manage your finances and build wealth, failure to purchase appropriate and adequate insurance can destabilize everything in a moment. On the other hand, buying insurance you do not need or paying too much for insurance would eat out your allocation for other purposes. It is thus extremely important to buy insurance products that are appropriate for your needs and that can cover financial losses due to uncertain events adequately. Some very common types of insurance that can be applicable to many are\u2014- life insurance for the main earner of the family, health insurance, accident covers for those who regularly use vehicles, motor insurance for costly vehicles you possess (2/4 wheelers, tractors, LCV), home insurance, pension/retirement policies (especially for the self-employed).

A policy is nothing but an agreement that lays out the basic rules of your contract with the insurance company. According to the rules of the policy, you pay \u2018premiums\u2019 at regular intervals to keep your policy up- to-date. The amount and frequency of your premium will be determined by the kind of insurance you purchase and the insurance company you take the policy from. If you keep your insurance payments up-to-date, should something you have insured yourself against happen, the insurance company will help you pay for the financial damage that occurs. The exact amount they pay and under what circumstances are all subject to the initial terms of your policy, so make sure that you understand these things well and always keep your policy up-to-date!",

I am getting married next month, and I think I should get a life insurance cover, also because it will save me some tax. So I went scouting for options, and I am thoroughly confused. First there are so many insurance companies; then there are various plans. I do not know how to get a plan that is correct for me? Dear Zach, Congratulations on your marriage next month. And more compliments for your responsible outlook towards this new phase of your life. Considering life insurance cover for yourself at this stage is indeed a very thoughtful and smart move. For one, the sooner you get a cover, the lower are the premiums and more your family is secured. Secondly, this is indeed a win-win way to ensure your family\u2019s financial security and at the same save taxes on your current income. One suggestion, do not determine the policy value based on tax saving. Instead take professional advice and use the guideline given in this section to determine exactly how much cover you would need. Now coming to your question about specific life insurance plans, you are indeed spoilt for choices these days. Earlier it used to be just one company and just a couple of types of plans for all. So naturally with so many options, there is bound to be confusion about what to choose. The good news is that these plans, by any insurance company, are designed to meet specific financial need.

Often mistaken as a last minute, year-end activity, tax planning proactively has much to offer beyond just saving taxes.

    "text": "138 About Compound Interest\u2014An important concept in financial planning Compound interest has been called the eighth wonder of the world. Albert Einstein called it one of the greatest mathematical concepts of our time. Compound interest is a concept of adding the interest to the principal back to it for the next term, so that this amount becomes principal for the next term and the whole amount earns interest. The power of compounding lies in its ability to turn a little bit of money, invested regularly into a whole lot of cash. It works like a snowball; when you save or invest, your money earns interest. The next year, you earn interest on your original money and the interest from the first year and interest on any further saving/ investment during the year. In the third year, you earn interest on your original money, any additional savings in the year (and the previous years) and the interest from the first two years. Thus if you continue to invest/ save every year, your every rupee invested so far earns more money, including the money you would have earned as interest in previous years. But watch out as compound interest can work against you on your debt/loans. If you have accumulated debt on your credit card, your money owed would keep increasing exponentially due to compounding of interest until you pay your debt fully. The trick then is to make this great force\u2014compound interest\u2014work for you rather than against you. Here are a few reminders from the book that will help you harness its power. 1. Start saving/investing as early as you can. 2. Keep saving/investing regularly\u2014even if it as a small amount every month. 3. Forget about your savings and investments\u2014as far as possible do not withdraw from your investments and do not bother about how slowly it is growing. 4. Repay debts in full and on time.",

Personal Finance - The Nuts and B olts All of us would love to be in control of our finances. In this chapter, you will learn what personal finance is and the importance of knowing it to help you become more efficient in managing money. Left on its own, money can be a bad master. You may find yourself working too hard for too little money. So, it is necessary to understand the concept of personal finance to manage your money smartly, even if you earn less. Personal finance helps you to have a tight grip on your money and utilise it wisely. You need not be super - rich to have a good financial life. Your monthly salary has little to do with deciding whether you are an expert in personal finance or not. You may earn Rs. 50,000 or Rs. 5 lakhs a month, but more income is no guarantee that you manage your finances well. Many individuals earning higher incomes suffer from money management problems to similar lower income earners.",

Just like life, solutions in personal finance only prove effective if you admit there is a problem. Doing so will enable you to develop an open - minded approach to learning the nitty - gritty of personal finance and absorb the concept with more clarity. But what if you are already well - versed in managing your finances? We recommend you continue reading this book because you may find useful insights that may sharpen your personal finance skills. What Is Personal Finance? You may not realise this, but your life is deeply connected with numbers. In school, you had to score well in academics to secure admission at a highly reputed college. Similarly, while participating in any sport, your victory depends on fairing numerically better than your opponent. If you wish to emerge as the best performer at your workplace, you need to deliver a higher quantitative output compared to your colleagues. It is all about attaining measurable goals. Personal finance is about meeting various financial goals that need to be clear and simple. A financial goal may be saving",

Additionally, a financial goal can be future - oriented, such as building a corpus worth Rs. 25 lakhs for your kid\u2019s higher education or earning lifelong income through pension investment plans even if you are a private sector employee. In football, one goal rarely ensures a win. Likewise, in life, different financial goals are running simultaneously. It is never about doing one thing at a time.

If you develop a solid plan balancing these aspects, success will knock on your doorstep. However, as you may know, it is challenging to make and follow an impressive financial plan. If you are earning well, your expenses tend to get out of control, as you spend more. When your expenses are on a tight leash, you are saving too little to invest.

People may understand general concepts like returns and profit. But are they aware that returns come with a risk factor?

You need to understand the fundamentals of money management to successfully use financial services like banking, insurance, mutual funds, or stocks. So, knowing personal finance is critical to making the right financial choices. 2. To Live Within Your Means Your dreams may be sky - high like owning a big car, buying a palatial house, going for annual overseas vacations, and wearing expensive clothes.

Additionally, you will become disciplined in money management since you will understand financial matters much better. 3. To Save and Invest Savings and investments are an integral part of personal finance. Merely earning money cannot solve problems. As Indians, our mindset has been to save our earnings. Unfortunately, most individuals tend to store their savings in idle assets like gold and non - financial assets like real estate. Even today, people find it safer to \u2018invest\u2019 in savings accounts of banks. However, it is not the best investment because the returns generated from a savings bank account are very low.

To Understand Taxes Do you know that your bank deposit\u2019s interest income is taxed? Do you know the tax you will pay on your fixed deposits (FDs) as per your income tax slab? So, if you fall in the highest tax slab of 30%, your FD interest income will be added to your income and taxed at the same rate. Additionally, if you plan to sell any owned property, you will be liable to pay taxes. Many people do not know the effect of taxes on their investments. So, when they have to pay the tax later, they realise their mistakes. However, it is too late by then. You may know the importance of earning a profit on investment. However, your profit will be taxed as per applicable rules. The good news is that you may save tax by making various investments. For instance, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 gives every individual the opportunity to lower their taxable income up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs . By using this investment opportunity, you can reduce your taxes. Developing expertise in personal finance will empower you to understand taxes and benefit from various taxation rules.

In this chapter, you will learn about the concept of saving, a few useful ideas to help you achieve your objective of saving smartly, and the different avenues where you can safeguard your hard - earned money.

But the massive wave of consumption has meant that saving money is now only an afterthought. You put in immense effort daily at your workplace, for which you receive a monthly salary that enables you to fund your immediate requirements and other materialistic desires, such as buying designer clothes or the latest electronic gadgets. But what would be your plan of action to manage certain inevitable expenses in the future? Would you intend to wait to organise the funds when situations arise, or do you wish to be financially prepared beforehand? It is quite understandable that, in all likelihood, you would choose the latter approach like any sensible financial planner. In the future, you may require funds to fulfill various financial commitments like your kid\u2019s education and wedding. So, it is necessary to inculcate the habit of savings right now, as the money earned today gets locked aside for tomorrow. What Is Saving? Saving is the money that you earn but not spend. Let us make you understand this with an illustration. Suppose your monthly salary is Rs. 56,000 and your monthly expenses amount to Rs. 39,000 per month, then in this scenario, your monthly savings would be Rs. 17,000 ( Rs. 56,000 - Rs. 39,000).",

Considering the above illustration, if you earn Rs. 56,000 monthly but end up spending Rs. 52,000 every month, you are saving only Rs. 4,000 per month. However, if you reduce your expenditure by Rs. 6,000, your monthly spending will drop to Rs. 46,000 from Rs. 52,000, ensuring you save Rs. 10,000 per month. You may also consider increasing your savings by supplementing your primary earnings with additional income streams, such as taking up freelance assignments in your area of expertise or doing some side hustle like stand - up comedy gigs if you have a funny b one or anything related to performing arts like singing, dancing, and acting at live events if you have the flair for that. However, this is easier said than done. In today\u2019s stressful and demanding professional environment, doing one full - time job can tak e a toll on anyone\u2019s health due to long working hours and a lack of work - life balance.

Do not wait for the month - end to review. Instead, monitor how the plan is working every week. This would help you to keep track of expenses and avoid spending more, resulting in savings.

You will have more self - control and ultimately save money. 3. Set up automatic savings It is the easiest and most effective way to save money. Ask your employer to deduct your income and put the deducted sum into a Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) , in case it is availabl e . Alternatively, you may consider investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) of mutual funds or purchase equity shares by opting for the \u2018auto debit\u2019 facility which is available to demat account holders, ensuring that the money is debited from your bank account automatically on a selected date and invested in your preferred SIP so that you do not end up spending unnecessarily.

Now, if he retains this amount in his bank account, it is his saving. However, if he puts this money into investment avenues like stocks and bonds, his savings of Rs. 18,000 becomes an investment. Investing originates from saving. Simply put, saving is keeping aside the money you do not spend now but wish to access quickly with no risk. Do note that not all savings are investments. Investing is buying assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, gold, or real estate. Generally speaking, an investment may either fall in the category of income - oriented or growth - oriented. For instance, if you deposited Rs. 2,000 in a savings bank account with a return of 4% annual interest, it would grow to Rs. 2,080 a year (before taxes). However, if you invest the same amount in a mutual fund earning an average of 10% a year, your investment would grow to Rs. 2,200 (before taxes). Making the correct choice between saving or investing",

But if saving alone cannot help you, supplement saving with investing. What are financial goals? The word \u2018goal\u2019 may remind you of a visual of a goalpost and a football screeching past the goal line into the net. As you may know, 11 players work together in a football team in synergy to score a goal. Similarly, your financial goals require coordination. A financial goal is your monetary objective and it is determined by the future requirement for money. Different financial goals arise during various phases of life. For instance, building a substantial retirement corpus 25 - 30 years from now maybe your long - term financial goal to help you achieve monetary freedom post - retirement. Simi larly, arranging funds for your kid\u2019s wedding which may happen after 10 years, or making the down payment for your home loan can qualify as another long - term financial goal. Con versely, saving money for a foreign trip that you plan to go on seven months later is your short - term financial goal. Once you acknowledge the need to achieve different financial goals during various stages of life, you start moving on the right track. Many people fail to accept the importance of accomplishing these goals due to which they falter in financial planning.",

The secret ingredient is to set up personal financial goals as per your projected monetary needs. For instance, if your monthly expenses would be Rs. 50,000 at the age of 60, you would need to have a stable income worth Rs. 60,000 at that time to meet the expenditure and have some savings in your bank account. Recogni sing your aspirations and future needs is 50% of the job done. The next 50% comprises setting up a plan to attain these goals. When it comes to breaking down financial goals, we can categorise them into three main types, short - term, medium - term, and long - term. Short - term Goals These are tasks that you may accomplish within 1 year. As you can understand, short - term goals are something that you aim to achieve soon. For instance, paying off credit card dues is a short - term goal. Similarly, a few other examples in this category may include buying household furniture, doing minor home improvements, or saving money to pay the down payment for a car loan or two - wheeler lo an. Additionally, arranging funds for going on a family holiday or buying gadgets comes under short - term goals. These goals are the easiest and quickest to attain.",

As you can see, medium - term goals take longer time than short - term goals. Before setting medium - term goals, be certain about the aspirations you wish to accomplish in the next few years. Having clarity about this will guide your saving and investing motives. Do remember that medium - term goals may be the hardest to achieve because they fall between short - and long - term goals. Short - term goals get complete attention since they always seem so close. Long - term goals also get a decent amount of attention because financial commitments like arranging sufficient funds for your kid\u2019s higher education or building a sizable retire ment corpus for your economic stability hold high relevance. So, this results in medium - term goals getting less time and importance. A good way to constantly track and monitor medium - term financial goals is to write them in a diary and review their progress every three months, ensuring they get adequate attention. So, in case you find out that you are falling behind, you will get time to get back on track and achieve these goals. As it takes around 5 years to accomplish medium - term goals, you may stay invested and not become risk averse. Contrary to short - term goals, which get accomplished",

Long - term Goals These goals generally take over 5 years to achieve. Long - term goals hold significant importance for you and your family. The time frame is longer in case of these goals because: 1. The financial requirement will arise after a long time. For instance, you will retire once your age is 60. You cannot prepone your retirement to the age of 35. 2. The amount required is high. So, you need to save and invest for long. For instance, if you expect to send your kid abroad for higher education at Rs. 30 lakhs and can invest only Rs. 4,000 per month, you will need 20 years to accomplish this target if the investment gives you a 10% return annually. Even if you double the investment to Rs. 8,000 per month, you will reach only Rs. 16.5 lakhs in 10 years.

APY provides you the facility to get a fixed pension of Rs. 1,000, Rs. 2000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000, or Rs. 5,000 once you reach the age of 60. In an APY, the pension corpus gets created from the contributions you invested in different assets. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDA) manages the collected amount under the scheme. In this scheme, aspects like the contributor\u2019s age and the contribution amount determine the pension. The contributor\u2019s spouse may stake claim to the pension upon the contributor\u2019s death. If the contributor and his/her spouse both passes away, their nominee will receive the accumulated corpus. If the contributor dies before reaching 60 years of age, the spouse has the facility to exit the scheme and claim the",

In order to qualify as an APY subscriber, you need to be an Indian citizen aged between 18 - 40 and make contributions for a minimum duration of 20 years. All the top banks provide the scheme. You may visit any of these bank branches to invest in an APY or start the process online from the comfort of your home. As an APY is an automatic investment scheme, all your periodic contributions get debited automatically from your bank account. Any default on your payments will attract a penalty. Default status on your payments for 6 months will lead to your APY account being frozen. If the default continues for 12 months, the account will be closed and the remaining amount will be paid back to the subscriber. If you wish to exit the APY before turning 60, you may be legally permitted to do so. However, in such a scenario, only your contributions and the net real accrued income earned on these contributions after deducting the account maintenance fee will be ret urned to you. 9.

When it comes to retirement planning, you may choose to invest your money in different avenues. However, according to the PFRDA website, the account maintenance cost under NPS is the lowest compared to similar pension products available in India, such as r etirement plans offered by insurance companies and mutual funds. You may switch between different pension funds and investment options, subject to certain regulatory restrictions. When you invest in an NPS, you may choose between the active choice or auto choice investment as well as the pension fund that manages the investments. The NPS auto choice investment comprises 3 Life Cycle (LC) funds, LC75, LC50, and LC25. LC75 is an aggressive life cycle fund in which the exposure in equity investments starts at 75% till your age is 35 and it gradually reduces once your age increases. LC50 is a moderate life cycle fund in which the exposure in equity investments starts at 50% until you reach the age of 35 and gradually declines with increasing age. LC25 is a conservative life cycle fund in which the exposure in equity investments starts at 25% until you are 35 years old and slowly reduces as you age.",

However, SWP is worth mentioning because, at the end of the day, the crux of investment is all about managing your future requirements and expenditures. Let us explain the co ncept of an SWP with an illustration. As an investor, you have invested meticulously to build a substantial retirement corpus. Once you retire, you receive the payout as planned and have a good bank balance. However, if you are not proficient in managing the money wisely, you may end up spendi ng it on unnecessary things, exposing the possibility of utili sing the corpus and being left with less savings in old age.

However, over the years, the concept of a life insurance plan has evolved considera bly. Today, different types of life insurance policies are available in the market. The most basic form of a life insurance plan is a term insurance policy, which provides insurance in case something untoward happens with the policyholder during the policy tenure. However, apart from this type, other life insurance policies provide a pac kage of insurance if something unfortunate happens and a return on investment once the policy matures and if the policyholder outlives the tenure. There is a debate on whether investing in insurance policies can prove to be worthwhile or not in the long run. However, we will explain the pros and cons of that later.

Asset allocation works broadly by dividing your investment across various unrelated asset classes, such as Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Securities, Sovereign Gold Bonds, real estate, physical gold, liquid cash in case of emergencies etc. You may decide how much percen t of your investment you wish to allocate to these different asset classes.

Investors can benefit from equities in two ways: capital appreciation and dividends . Capital appreciation occurs when the stock price increases over time. Dividends are payments made by the company to its shareholders, often representing a portion of the company's profits.

In an investment portfolio, gold offers long - term returns. It can help reduce losses when the stock market is going through a turbulent phase. It is a liquid asset with no credit risk. Gold has been a valuable asset for centuries, prized for its beauty, durability, and scarcity. As an investment, gold offers unique characteristics that make it a distinct asset class. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. When prices rise, the value of gold tends to increase, providing a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power. Gold can help diversify an investment portfolio. Its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can reduce overall risk. There are many ways to invest in Gold like buying physical gold, Gold ETFs, and Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), which are government securities denominated in grams of gold. They are substitutes for holding physical gold. Investors have to pay the",

They are usually held by high - net worth individuals and institutional investors. Some alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, artworks, and antiques. With innovations in the financial market, these instruments have become more approachable for smaller investors through ETFs and SIPs. What Is the Main Objective of Asset Allocation? The core motive of asset allocation is to minimise losses, as doing so will eventually result in more gains. Many investors use asset allocation to minimise volatility. If you are unaware of what volatility means, in simple words, it is the swing due to which an asset gets impacted. Here is an illustration to give you better clarity .",

Allocating or dividing your investment does not mean blindly investing in different asset classes in varying proportions without analytical research. Doing this may prove costly. For instance, in 2008, the value of most of the financial assets fell, and only gold did well. So, if you divide your investments equally among all asset classes, you may still experience losses, particularly during unfavorable market conditions. Asset allocation works based on a few theories.

The answer depends on how you define the \u2018work\u2019 in this context. If your investments in an asset category are performing poorly, asset allocation will ensure you have well - performing assets in another category. Any gains in the well - performing asset class may offset the losses in the poor - performing ones. This means both your gains and losses reduce as far as the overall effect on your portfolio is concerned. So, if your goal is to ensure lower risk and minimal losses, asset allocation will wonderfully work for you. If your goal is to avoid investing in low - performing assets and always stay invested in high - performing assets, this will be tough to achieve. The truth is, neither you nor a skilled investment professional knows the accurate amount of gains or losses one or many assets will make. The benefit is available only in hindsight.

Unit - linked insurance plan It is a combination of insurance and investment. The premium paid towards a ULIP is partly used as a risk cover for life insurance. The insurance company invests a large portion of the ULIP premium in funds. You may invest in different funds offered by the insurer depending o n your risk tolerance level. ULIPs are a close competitor of mutual funds when it comes to earning high returns on investment. However, costs associated with the ULIP structure make this investment - cum - insurance product competitive only if you hold it for the long term. ULIPs can help you save taxes on investment, and their corpus is tax - free. There are many similarities between ULIPs and mutual funds, but ULIPs also contain the plus point of being an insurance - oriented product. Conversely, mutual funds are a pure investment avenue with no insurance benefits.",

Here, you receive a portion of the sum assured at regular intervals. If the policyholder outlives the term, they get the balance sum assured. However, if they do not survive during the policy tenure, their beneficiary gets the full sum assured. Money - back plans are also eligible to receive the bonuses declared by the company. Like other insurance products, a money - back policy is a tax - saving avenue, and its returns are tax - free for the policyholder/legal heir/nominee. Why Should You Not Mix Insurance with Other Investment Avenues? When you invest your hard - earned money somewhere, you may expect returns. This approach holds true, especially for pure investment avenues. So, is a term insurance plan an investment avenue? No. Life insurance is not an investment. In life insurance, if the policyholder dies, their nominee /beneficiary gets the money. In any investment, you, as an investor, enjoy the returns. In the case of life insurance, the death benefit is designed in such a manner that the policyholder cannot reap its financial benefits. You may wonder how other life insurance policies, barring term insurance plans, give maturity benefits to the policyholder. Well, those policies are not pure term insurance",

Apart from term insurance, any other form of life insurance is costlier. Remember the death benefit of a term life insurance policy is its only advantage. When you buy any other form of insurance, such as a money - back plan or an endowment plan, you are not buying pure insurance. You are paying for a package of insurance and investment. With so many investment avenues available in the market, there is little reason to buy an insurance policy for investment purposes. In a term plan, you pay a premium for covering a specific risk. If the risk doesn\u2019t happen, you lose the premium. It is fine because you pay a nominal amount. But if the risk event occurs, your nominee/beneficiary gets the promised money. So, a term plan comes at a low premium. If you w ish to invest, consider putting your money in pure instruments like direct stocks and mutual funds. But, do not buy life insurance policies to merely invest. How Much Insurance Do You Need? All of us face this question in the process of buying life insurance.

So, the life insurance cover will be the sum of meeting these goals. Here are two pivotal factors that may help you decide the ideal life insurance amount you may require: 1. Your current income In case of an untoward event, you will need to ensure your family survives for at least 20 years. So, multiply your annual income by 20. So, if your current yearly income is Rs. 5 lakhs , multiply it by 20 and your life insurance cover should be a minimum of Rs. 1 crore ( Rs. 5 lakhs x 20). 2. Your current and future financial liabilities List your present and future financial liabilities to calculate the required life insurance cover.

Even after buying life insurance, many families discover that at the claim stage, their policies are worthless, and they face rejections. Here are some reasons for that: 1. Incorrect information given at the time of application Insurance operates on the principle of trust. So, any form of misrepresentation of data is bad for life insurance claims. Providing wrong information about age, income, occupation, qualifications, lifestyle, and medical history will open the door for rejected claims in the future. 2. Non - disclosure of medical status The willful non - disclosure of previous and existing medical conditions, operations, and surgeries leads to claim rejections. The insurance company needs accurate information about your medical history to calculate the policy premium. If you give wrong information, the entire premise of the policy is based on falsehood.

One of the most important tasks in retirement planning is to calculate how much post - retirement income you require. This calculation may seem tough given that retirement may be 20 - 30 years away for a young person. However, you still need a number to get a clear idea.

Be aware of life\u2019s complexities Despite intelligence and practical experiences, most people refuse to believe their family members will not fight over their assets. It is true when you ask them what happens after they are no more. Being optimistic is great, but do not be blind to the realities of life. 2. Learn the facts Many people hold assets in joint names with a spouse and erroneously assume that if the husband dies, the wife will become the owner automatically. It is not true. If the husband dies without writing a will, his share will first go to his surviving class - 1 legal heirs, which include his wife, kids, and mother. They will have equal rights on his share in that asset. 3. List down your assets Many individuals have acquired precious assets over time but fail to maintain a list of what they own.

Importance of Estate Planning for a Women Here are two reasons why estate planning is necessary for a woman: 1. Conventional role of women in an Indian household Estate planning has a crucial role to play in the lives of many people. But when it is about women, it becomes much more important. Traditionally, in the Indian culture, due to a lack of economic resources, women find themselves dependent on their parents, husbands, and kids.

Due to this life - changing scenario, she would need to undergo a complete mental transition because earlier, it was her husband who managed everything. 2. Need to defy societal perception Many may oppose assets like houses, land, cars, and shares registered under women\u2019s names, as the perception is that women may not be equipped to control the assets. After the husband dies, social hierarchy and the weight of traditions may make it extremely difficult for a woman to exert ownership. The modern working woman may not be different in this aspect. Despite having a professional career and earning independently, she may be asked to seek advice on important financial decisions like investments, taxation, and personal finance from her male relati ves. Without a proper ecosystem, women can never exert their rights and manage assets. So, it is the husband\u2019s duty to do efficient estate planning in such a way that his loving wife never faces any legal trouble after his demise. You need not be a millionaire to have an estate. Your estate comprises your home, other properties, investments, insurance policies, bank accounts, retirement plans, and direct/indirect interests in businesses, if any.

A proper way to do estate planning is by writing a will. A will is a legal declaration of the intention. The one who makes the will is called the testator. The will tells people what the testator wishes to do with respect to their property after death. So, a will informs the testator\u2019s family what will happen to the testator\u2019s assets after they die. Who Is Eligible to Make a Will?

Irrespective of whether you wish to invest in mutual funds via the online or offline mode, you need to be KYC - compliant before venturing into this lucrative investment avenue. KYC norms track the legality of money used by an investor in an investment. KYC is a one - time process. Every first - time mutual fund investor must follow KYC regulations to invest in a mutual fund. You may visit any of these websites to check your KYC status online: 1. www.kra.ndml.in 2. www.karvykra.com 3. www.cvlkra.com 4. www.camskra.com",

It was notified as a \u2018 Recognise d Stock Exchange\u2019 under Section 2(39) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India, on December 21, 2012.

Smart investors use such a basket approach with investments to earn a profit. No matter how you build a portfolio, the investment journey is not like a straight line. It is full of ups and downs. However, when smartly curated and monitored, a well - planned investment portfolio can navigate difficult times and help you generate wealth over the long term. In this chapter, we will find out how to create an all - weather portfolio. What Are Asset Classes in an Investment Portfolio? The assets included in an investment portfolio are called asset classes. As an investor, you need to ensure your portfolio contains a good mix of assets. A well - balanced mix helps foster growth for the investment capital, with controlled risk. An ideal investment portfolio should contain stocks. They refer to a portion or share of a company. Stocks can be a source of income when the company shares its profits with shareholders by way of dividends. However, the main purpose of buying stocks is capital appreciation. Shares sold at a higher price than their purchase price generate profit. Bonds are an important part of any portfolio. A bond is a loan and comes with a maturity date when you receive the",

Gold, cash, and real estate are other common asset classes in an investment portfolio. These assets may offer lower returns than stocks, but make your portfolio more diversified. Cash is a liquid asset, and you may adjust its proportion in your portfolio t o increase or decrease the exposure of the other asset classes. Types of Portfolios Investment portfolios may be in various shapes and sizes, depending on your investment strategy. Growth Portfolio A growth portfolio aims to get higher returns by taking greater risks. This means the portfolio will have a higher weight of stocks/shares. Growth investing involves investments in new companies, such as small - caps and mid - caps. Income Portfolio An income portfolio offers you stability with some recurring inflow.

We believe learning to deal with this from school onwards will help in financial inclusion. If individuals and households are financially literate to make informed decisions about how to save, borrow and invest, this may help generate a sense of financial well being. The present book also includes a discussion on helping the financially marginalised also improve their situation, because children need to be sensitised to such issues of access and social justice. The NCERT has been receiving requests from the Ministry of Human Resources and Development and Ministry of Finance, Income Tax Department for inclusion of personal finance and components of taxation in the school curriculum. The Reserve Bank of India has also constituted a Core Committee on Financial Education of which NCERT is a member. Thus, the present book is an outcome of the initiatives by several organisations to impart financial education among young learners, enabling the country to pursue its goal of financial inclusion. This practical-oriented material has been developed by the Department of Education in Social Sciences, National Institute of Education to supplement the material already developed in Commerce and Economics. It has taken a little longer than expected to develop this material because it is the first of its kind. Several academics in the country have also been looking forward to it, to use in their teaching.

They often, hear them talk about saving for buying another car, new model of television, double- door refrigerator, latest model of washing machine and so on. There seems to be a never ending list and nobody seems to agree upon any purchase of a particular item. The children desire an LCD television set, their mother wants a refrigerator while father wants to possess a new car and grandparents want to deposit money in the bank to be used at a later date. The priorities of the family members differ in terms of their needs, utility and the price of various household items. However, all of them are making a choice which has financial implications for the family. The option will require a careful analysis of the families' income, expenses and savings. Since the amount of money available with the family is limited, some purchases may have to be deferred or postponed to a future date. Therefore, it would be appropriate if they decide in advance what to buy keeping in view their income and expenses. They take a decision to purchase a car as it would serve the interest of all and everyone will enjoy its benefits. All of us at some time or the other have taken major and minor financial decisions in our life. Your parents may have asked you to choose between going for a school trip or purchase a new computer game. The school trip may cost ` 3000/- and the computer game 3500/-.

We are all part of the financial decision making process and are affected by our family's financial situation. You have observed in your daily life that spending, financing, investing are becoming part of your routine activities. These decisions are all components of personal finance. Therefore, personal finance can be said to be the process of planning your spending, financing and investing activities that affect your financial situation. However, before you begin to plan, you will have to think about your needs and then accordingly prioritise your goals. Thus, the process of financial planning will include two steps: (I) to specify your goals, and (ii) to describe your spending, financing and investing plans to achieve those goals. Financial planning helps you to ensure that you will have funds available to meet your present as well as future needs. In India, there is a culture of saving for some future event or contingency or an asset to be acquired. Usually, some money is kept aside for this if it is surplus. In the middle income groups, there may be little or no savings due to high prices of essential items. This is where it becomes important to think of a personal financial plan. In contrast in advanced countries, like America, individuals tend to rely too much on credit cards which sometimes puts them in debt. They do not think of saving money and usually spend all their monthly income. Despite the difference in the cultural as well as economic position of the countries all individuals need to plan their finances in order to have some surplus and avoid debt. When people or households do not have any savings, it becomes problematic in difficult times or emergencies like paying for hospital expenses, repairs in case of accident or other necessities. Similarly, if you have savings then there are numerous options to channelise your savings such as like bank deposits, insurance plans, shares etc. Thus, being financially prepared for such exigencies makes life much easier. Once you have a financial plan, a lot of financial issues relating to savings and expenses get streamlined.

Why Personal Finance The main purpose of personal finance education is to positively influence financial behaviour. It has been observed that such education is delivered more effectively to younger children than to their older counterparts. Knowledge of personal finance is beneficial for everyone in many ways. Make your own financial decisions An understanding of personal finance helps you take informed decisions about your financial situation. When you spend money on a particular thing you are giving up something else. For example, if you purchase a book for `. 500/- you are sacrificing maybe, a video game of the same amount or you could have saved that money for the future. There are various alternatives which you could have considered and you have to choose one and forgo the others. What you give up as a result of your buying decision is what we call opportunity cost. Evaluate the advice of financial advisors You may have come across various insurance agents, trying to sell policies or agents for different mutual funds. If you are aware of financial matters then it becomes easy to assess the various alternatives given by financial advisors. Financial advisors usually give you advice and guide you on your savings and investment. They may sometimes make false claims and guarantee high returns on particular investments. Your understanding of personal finance will enable you to determine whether their advice is in your best interests or theirs.

At times, many employees go on paying high taxes because they do not know that by investing in certain securities or contributing to their provident funds they may save on taxes. There is a demand for financial advisors and a course in personal finance or other finance related courses can help you pursue a career as a financial advisor. They usually charge a commission on the amount of investment made from the source of the securities, for example, the post office or the company connected with the mutual funds. At a later stage, if they are enterprising and have a good understanding of financial matters they get paid for their specialised knowledge. Instilling Financial Discipline All of us need to be disciplined when it comes to spending money. If you have to live with a limited income your expenses have to be regulated. Same is true for your pocket money; you have to make sure your money lasts through the whole month. Parents have to make sure that the money is not misused and is judiciously spent. 03 Each individual or family is different so will have their own financial plans. One cannot expect to have same financial plan as another even if two people are earning the same salary. This is because financial situations and risk taking ability are different. Suppose a person already has to pay a housing loan instalment (EMI) and take care of other personal responsibilities, then his risk taking ability would be much lower than a person who does not have to repay a loan. How exactly do you go about preparing a financial plan? \u25aa Assess your finances. Make a list of your bank accounts, investments, fixed deposits, mutual funds, shares etc. \u25aa What are your expenses per month? How much do you spend on rents or instalments (EMIs), your kids' education, monthly kitchen expenses and so on. You will be able to understand where you are with respect to your income, expenses and savings. \u25aa Now the next step would be to list down your goals which could be short term, medium term or long term. Your short-term goals could be buying a car or going on a vacation, let us presume in the next 5 years. Your medium-term goals could be your child's education, buying a house, or setting up your own business. This could be planned for may",

I) Budgeting ii) Managing your money iii) Financing large purchases iv) Protecting assets v) Investing money vi) Planning your retirement vii) Tax Planning Budgeting We have heard people say that spending is going out of our budget. What is a budget? A budget is a statement of your income, expenses and saving. Budgeting therefore, is the process of forecasting future income and expenses for a given period. The surplus shown in your budget would be savings. Savings may be less or more depending upon how much you spend. Budgeting can therefore help you estimate how much of your income is required for monthly expenses and how much you will be able to save each month. You may use your saving for investing in bank deposits or in the financial markets or purchasing an asset such as a car or paying off your loan. Budgeting is a process where you evaluate your current financial position by assessing your income, expenses, assets and liabilities. Your budget is influenced by your income because you can only spend what you earn. Then the next step in the budgeting process is to estimate your expenses to be incurred every month. If you are able keep current expenditure levels low, your savings will be higher and you will be able to accumulate wealth in the future. Budget is the foundation of your financial plan, as it provides a base for making personal financial decisions. Managing your money You need cash to meet your daily expenses. Cash is required for daily minor expenses as well as major contingencies like repairs or medical treatment etc. For all this access to funds is necessary to cover any short-term cash needs. Your liquidity position is basically determined by how much cash you have in hand or what can be accessed immediately. Money management and credit management are two techniques to enhance your liquidity position. Money management involves decisions regarding how much money to carry in liquid form and how much to allocate to short-term investment. Credit management involves decisions about how much credit you need to support your spending and the sources of credit to use. If you fall short of money then what other sources can you fall back on? Can you go to a bank, friends, employer or",

Credit management involves decisions about how much credit you need to support your spending and the sources of credit to use. If you fall short of money then what other sources can you fall back on? Can you go to a bank, friends, employer or credit card facility? Credit card facilities should be used less as interest rates are exorbitant. It is normally used to cover expenses that cannot be covered by current income. Financing large purchases Huge expenditures like purchase of a car or a house often are financed by a loan. How much loan to take will depend upon your savings and the purchase price of the assets. The capacity to repay the loan is also an important consideration. Loans are available in easy instalment of monthly, six monthly or annual system of repayment. The interest rate charged also is different for different schemes of loan and its repayment. There are, therefore, four things to consider: (i) how much loan to take, (ii) Maturity or length of the loan (iii) Interest rate and (iv) Instalment plan. Protecting assets Insurance plans are available to protect your assets. Insurance companies offer different types of insurance policies with varying amounts of premium to be paid depending on the risk associated. Car insurance, house insurance, health insurance are some of the popular policies for different amounts. Investing money",

You may invest your saving in bank deposits for different periods with varied rates of interest if you wish to opt for a safe investment. Or if you are willing to take risk you may invest in the capital market, i.e., in shares or bonds or mutual funds. A risk return analysis may be done and funds may be invested according to your requirement. Planning your retirement After retirement you do not get a fixed amount as salary, therefore a certain amount must be set aside and invested so that some return is assured at a later stage. This type of planning could be done well in advance so that sufficient money is accumulated to support yourself and your family. For example, you may be investing in provident funds, public provident fund, national saving certificate, etc., which can give you an income after retirement. Tax Planning Taxes are an essential component of financial plan. Whatever you earn, part of it has to be paid to the Government in the form of taxes. However, tax planning enables you to plan your investment in such a way so as to minimise your tax. Have a plan and watch your investments grow Discipline Discipline is a key to managing your money better. Go through these points and add others. Having a discipline and planning for the future is a must. One must adopt a method, i.e., asset allocation and stick to investment in various assets and financial products without getting swayed by short-term changes. Financial Plan Determine your financial goals, get a certified financial planner to help you reach your financial goals based on the risk you wish to take. Stick to your financial plan and do not get swayed away with new products and new promises. There are many investment proposals that promise to double your money in a year. There is a need to filter the advice of financial advisors.

Awareness of personal finance enables them to reflect upon crucial details such as interest rates, mortgages, credit cards, saving, investment and expenditure and helps them to prepare for uncertainty in life. The value of living within one's means and saving as much money provides for a good financial outcome as well as a guarantee for the future. Pay full credit cards bill on due date Remember if you do not pay the entire bill on the due date, interest is charged from the date of spending and not the due date for payment. That factor alone can push up the credit rate to over 40% per annum and this makes it probably the most expensive form of credit. Source: The Economics Times 06",

What did we spend it on? We have nothing to show for it. This happens because we do not correctly assess our expenses and plan accordingly. Therefore, we need to be in control of our personal finances. If we make a budget, a statement showing cash flows and a personal balance sheet we know what our position is and what further steps may be taken to control the situation. A budget, as we all know, is a statement showing future income, expenses and savings. It is based on some estimates. These estimates are one income which are our source of cash inflows and expenses which are cash outflows. We need to prepare a personal cash flow statement which measures cash inflows and cash outflows. By keeping a check on our cash outflows we may be able to monitor our spending and allocate some amount towards savings. Cash Inflows \u2013 Where does our cash come from ? For working people, salary is the main source of cash inflows. Other sources may be interest from bank",

Expenses will include both large and small. In our daily life we incur so many small expenses like buying groceries, paying for our bus tickets, paying bills for telephone, water and electricity which may all add up to huge amounts. Paying rent, purchasing a car or paying your monthly instalments are examples of large expenses. It is normally the small expenses which go out of hand and is difficult to keep track of them. Recording these transactions will help you sum up your cash outflows. Preparing a personal cash flow statement Now that you have an idea of your cash inflows and outflows, it is easy to prepare a personal cash flow statement. First of all you need to record your cash inflows, i.e., how much is your income, how much cash you receive from interest or dividend or any other source. Then, you may add up your expenses for that period (it may be monthly or annually). Thereafter, by deducting your expenses (outflows) from your income (inflows) you will arrive at the figure of net cash flows. Some tips about budgeting Budgets are necessary. They're the only practical way to get a grip on your spending and to make sure your money is being used the way you want it to be used. Creating a budget generally requires three steps. \u25aa Identify how you're spending money now. \u25aa Evaluate your current spending and set goals that take into account your long-term financial objectives. \u25aa Track your spending to make sure it stays within those guidelines. Electronic devices like mobile phone, calculator, digital diaries, laptop, etc., can be used for recording income and expenses. You can create your personal financial statement so as to get a quick check on your financial position. Don't overburden yourself. Monitor your spending but don't get over involved with accounting for every rupee. Example Arun after finishing college gets a placement as an Assistant Manager with a business firm exporting garments. The firm pays him a salary of ` 27,000/- per month. After paying taxes of ` 2000/- Arun wants to monitor his spending so he decides to prepare personal cash flow statement for the last month.

Basically, to increase your net cash flows you will either have to earn more or spend less, i.e., maximize cash inflows and minimize cash outflows. Factors affecting cash flows We will have to analyse both cash inflows and cash outflows. It is only the net cash flows which enhance your wealth since you can save it or invest it further to earn a higher income. Cash Inflows Your income is the major source of cash inflows. Your qualifications and the stage at which you are in are the two factors affecting your income level. Then other sources are interest income, dividend, rent from property etc.",

As they grow and develop in their career, their salaries increase, allowances increase, their experience enables them to get other higher post jobs, etc. This normally has a direct correlation with your age. The older you get your salary structure and status improve. But it may so happen that when jobs are changed older people do not get the commensurate salary. Your cash inflows or your salary therefore depends upon your career and the stage of your career. Type of job Some jobs are very well paid. In India, professionals or people with specialized skills earn much more. Engineers, management professionals, lawyers, are usually paid higher salaries. Doctors who are also highly qualified, unfortunately, in India, are not well paid. If you are self employed, then your cash inflows will depend upon the hard work and the time, energy and dedication you put into your work. Number of working people in your household The households' cash inflows also depends upon the other earning members in the household. Obviously, the household with more than one income earner will be more comfortable and the total cash inflows will increase. Cash Outflows Cash outflows are the expenses incurred on various items and assets. These depend upon the person's family size, age and consumption patterns. Family size If you are the only earning member and supporting a large family, then expenses will be high. It also depends upon the number of school going children where high fees are to be paid, expenditure on clothing, transport, etc., will also be high. Where the numbers of dependants are less, expenses are lower and these households normally have a capacity to save. Age As people grow older their expenses change and they may tend to spend on assets like cars, houses, land, etc. Their expenditure on school tuition fees, household items decreases and they have more cash to spare for purchasing a house or a car or going for vacations abroad. And then they may still have some money to spare for investing. Personal consumption patterns People have different consumption patterns, some like to spend extravagantly and spend most of their money on expensive things as soon as they get their salary. Middle class families usually spend their money in the beginning of the month and they are left with little",

Personal consumption patterns People have different consumption patterns, some like to spend extravagantly and spend most of their money on expensive things as soon as they get their salary. Middle class families usually spend their money in the beginning of the month and they are left with little to save. Then there are some people who are always saving for some contingency or some dream house they want to buy. Their expenditure is the bare minimum but their savings are large. Cash flows will therefore depend upon consumption behaviour. Savings will also depend on a family's/individual's consumption pattern and spending. Consumption pattern is also affected by the amount you have to spend. The income you earn will determine your consumption behaviour like if there are two persons earning in the family, that household spends more. Preparing a Budget In the personal cash flow statement, we recorded actual income, expenses and savings. If we need to find out net cash flows in the future we can forecast the cash inflows and outflows for each item on the personal cash flow statement. This cash flow statement based on forecast income and expenses for a future time period is called a budget.

It is possible that your expenses (out flows) are less in the next month and you may be able to save the excess amount of cash for purchasing something you want. Or else your expenses will exceed your income (cash inflows) and you will have to make some kind of arrangement either borrow or pay through your credit card to cover your extra expenses. If you know in advance what is to be done, you are better prepared to face the situation. In the same example taken earlier, suppose Arun anticipates his spending to go up next month by ` 1000/- due to extra travelling and he would have to pay ` 12,000/- towards his father's medical treatment.

He then has to arrange for this contingency. Create your own budget Assess your monthly expenses. Make sure you record all your regular monthly expenses, including what you spend on eating out, entertainment and hobbies. Total your earnings. Calculate how much you make per month, including any money that you receive from investments and other forms of residual income. Match your expenses with earnings.

    "text": "12 Why prepare a budget? Preparing a budget actually helps in anticipating cash shortages, checking the accuracy of the budget and forecasting net cash flows for future. Anticipating cash shortages If you are likely to have a cash shortage in the next month you can make arrangements to overcome it. Maybe you could withdraw funds from another account and manage somehow. If the amount is large, you might need to borrow from a friend or relative or maybe take a loan against a fixed deposit or dissolve the fixed deposit. The deficiency can be covered if one is forewarned and has sufficient time to arrange for funds. An emergency fund could also be created and some money kept aside for such purposes. Assessing the accuracy of the budget Since a budget is a statement of anticipated cash inflows and outflows, it will be generally prudent to compare the actual cash flows with forecast cash flows. Usually, we tend to overestimate cash inflows (income) and underestimate a cash outflows (expenses), as a result the net cash flows are less than expected. Budgeting, therefore, helps us to limit our spending so as to adjust to the limited income inflows. Or else, we try to increase our income to pay for those extra comforts. Forecasting net cash flows Budgets can be prepared weakly, monthly or annually. Expenses can be forecast months in advance and by following the same procedure a sum total of cash outflows can be determined. Similarly, if there are any other sources of income like interest on fixed deposits, or rent from property they can also be summed up for each period and net cash flows can be computed. In this manner, at least over the next few months, things can be quite accurately predicted. Positive net cash flows If positive net cash flows over a period of time are anticipated, you can plan for purchasing property, can or actually buying in instalments and pay equated monthly instalments (EMIs) towards owning an asset. These positive net cash flows are your savings which can turn into investments. You may invest your Rework your budget.

He was told by his company that salary for all its employees is given only through cheques and that he has to open a savings bank account in a nearby bank to get salary in cash. He was perplexed. Why? Later on, when he applied for a credit card he was told by the bank issuing credit card that he has to have a bank account, monthly statement and his financial transactions of his account for the previous six months. Why? Managing money is an important component of our life. If we study in a school, college or in an institution, we need to learn to manage money we get from parents and guardians for paying fees, to buy books and stationary or to use as pocket money. As grown-ups, when we work for a firm or running our own firm, we need to learn to manage our incomes from our work or profits from our firms. In this chapter we will try to answer questions Ashish has raised and suggest him what to do. In our day-to-day life, we manage our money in the form of coins and currencies and deposits with banks; we also use cheques, withdraw cash from automated telling machines (ATMs) using debit cards and purchase goods using credit cards. In India, besides banks, we also put our money in post offices as well. 14",

We get a variety of services from banks ranging from selling gold to work as financial advisors. We get interest on savings we make and we are charged interest on loans we get from banks. You can also get similar banking services from post offices as well. Even though we do not get a variety of banking services that we get from banks, post offices play a very important role in promoting savings habit among people in rural and urban areas and at the same time contribute to country's development by meeting its financial requirements. In India, more than 150 banks with hundreds of their branches \u2013 both in public and in private sectors and nearly 1.5 lakh post offices play crucial role in managing our money. We will learn some important banking services provided by banks and post offices such as (i) savings account; (ii) current account; (iii) fixed deposit and (iv) recurring deposit and support services such as (a) cheque book facilities; (b) ATM cum-debit cards; (c) financing credit cards (d) money transfer and the Internet and mobile banking facilities. Savings Account We can use this facility to save a part of our current incomes to meet our future needs and also intend to earn an income from our savings. Banks offer a reasonable rate of interest for our savings but impose restrictions on the savings account. From our savings account, we cannot withdraw beyond the stipulated amount within a given period. The number of withdrawals in a month or a day is also restricted. In savings accounts, we need to deposit a minimum amount in the beginning and also retain certain minimum amount with the bank. This amount varies if we want to avail other facilities such as cheque books. Requirements for opening an account in a bank Most banks in India require one of the following documents for opening an account. Photo Identity: (i) Passport; (ii) Permanent Account Number (PAN) card; (iii) Voter ID card; (iv) Driving licence; (v) Government ID card; (vi) Ration card; or (vii) Senior citizen ID card.

Source: www.icici.com Banks impose service charges on savings accounts when (i) minimum balance is not maintained and (ii) the number of withdrawals and amount of withdrawals exceed the stipulated limit. Banks also have the discretion to waive these service charges to a few customers on certain grounds. The rate of interest payable by the banks on deposits maintained in savings account is prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. However, a few banks are authorized to give an additional interest of \u00bc or \u00bd per cent. At present, most banks including post offices pay about 3.5% as interest for savings account deposits. The rate of interest is paid irrespective of whether cheque book facility is availed by the account",

Now-a-days, in rural areas workers engaged in unorganised sector jobs such as works available under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 and those working in private sector are encouraged to open savings account in banks and post offices. If you are a farmer, banks encourage you to open savings account and avail various banking services. Discuss Renuka and her husband sell vegetables on the roadside. They are able to save about ` 400 per day after meeting all the expenses of running the vegetable shop. They wish to put their savings either in post office or bank. Which one they can choose and why? Post offices and a few banks issue passbooks containing our transactions with the bank. A few others such as ICICI do not have this option but keep their customers updated by sending a monthly statement. Some banks also give their phone numbers so that we can call over phone to know our transactions. While there is no limit imposed by banks to deposit our savings, we can only save up to a certain amount in post office savings account. Individuals can save only up to ` 1 lakh. If the savings account is opened by more than one person, also known as joint account, you can save up to ` 2 lakh only. Income earned as interest is taxable in banks' savings account, no tax is charged on the interest received from post office savings account. In order to attract customers of different income groups, banks and post offices offer a variety of savings account facilities. Minor Account A child account is similar to regular savings account. However, it is opened under a minor saving account The account includes a free passbook, a debit card on the permission of a parent, facility to transfer money from parents' account, cheque book and the Internet banking access.

A stark reminder of financial indiscipline is the increasing chances of account being inactive when not used for a year. A child will not learn unless parents spend time with her.

By opening current account, we can do numerous financial transactions every day. Normally, money is withdrawn or payments are made through cheques. There is no restriction on the number and the amount of withdrawals from a current account. There are no interest payments for money kept in current account. Generally, banks do not collect any service charge for maintaining current accounts. Most banks do not provide any interest for current accounts. Current account carries certain privileges which are not given to a savings bank account holder. For example, (i) third party cheques 1 and cheques with endorsements can be deposited in the current account for collection and credit; (ii) overdraft facilities \u2013 you can issue cheque to make payments even if you do not have money in your account at the time of issuing cheques.

The minimum amount you can put in fixed deposit is ` 200. The duration of fixed deposit is 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and the rates of interest are 6.25%, 6.50%, 7.25%, 7.5%. The amount you earn from interest payments is compounded quarterly for 1, 2, 3 and 5 years. Unlike savings account in which you cannot save beyond a limit, post office fixed deposits allow to save as much as possible. People who save in post office fixed deposit account also need not have to pay taxes for the amount they deposit . Suppose you have opened a fixed deposit account for either 2, 3, or 5 years, you need to wait at least one year to complete. Post offices also offer an account facility called Post Office Monthly Income Account which ensures a regular monthly income. In this scheme, a maturity period (6 years) is fixed. Suppose you deposit ` 12, 000 with the post office, you will get ` 80 per month to your savings account. Rate of interest for such an account is 8% per annum. However, you can deposit only a fixed amount. For example, if you are an individual, you can deposit ` 4.5 lakh and the maximum limit for joint account of two adult persons is ` 9 lakh. If you want your deposits back for some emergency purposes or for putting into some other forms of investment, you may withdraw the amount after a certain period. In such cases, post offices deduct one or two per cent of your deposits and allow you to close your account prematurely. Facilities for Senior Citizens By now we are aware that rate of interest is an important consideration for people to deposit their incomes or savings. Post offices offer a deposit facility in which retired persons or persons aged 55 and above who are willing to deposit their savings and pension and other social security benefits for a specific period and wish to earn a high rate of interest regularly. Known as Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, this deposit account facility allows old age people either individually (aged 55 and above) or with their spouse to deposit up to ` 15 lakh.

Known as Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, this deposit account facility allows old age people either individually (aged 55 and above) or with their spouse to deposit up to ` 15 lakh. The rate of interest for this account facility is around 9 per cent with the maturity period of 5 years. As in the case of other fixed deposit accounts, you can also close your accounts prematurely but the post offices will charge 1 or 1.5 per cent interest. These account holders need not have to pay taxes for the amount they save but will be required to pay a very small amount for the interest they earn. Suppose you have savings account facility in the same post office where you have deposited, you can convert your interest automatically to get credited to your savings account. You can also convert your savings you earn through your fixed deposit to recurring deposit so your income from savings rises. In this way, people save, put their money in post office in fixed deposits and earn rate of interest of around10.5% per annum as well.

Sweep Accounts: Make your idle cash earn more Your deposit in savings account (SB) gives only a small return but is highly liquid whereas the fixed deposits (FD) earn relatively a higher return but are not liquid. In recent times, banks offer a deposit option combining the positive sides of both deposit facilities. Referred to as sweep, auto-sweep, flexi deposit or some hybrid scheme (for example, SBI has named as Savings Plus), this facility allows you to link your SB account to a FD. Sweep accounts allow you to transfer some amount kept in savings account to fixed deposit, known as sweep-out. Sweep-in facility allows you to shift the required amount from FD to the SB account. Any amount that exceeds the pre-set threshold in a SB account is automatically transferred to the FD account, earning you a higher interest. If you need to withdraw some money that is more than the threshold limit, the required amount gets swept into your SB account. This arrangement eliminates the need to break the fixed deposit and you lose interest only on the amount that is actually used. Sweep accounts also do away with the need to keep a large sum",

The interest we get in this account is relatively higher than what we get from savings account facilities. One important recurring deposit facility available in post offices is 5-Year Post Office Recurring Deposit Account. Any individual or two adults jointly can open this account. We can deposit minimum of `. 10 per month (and the multiples of 5 and thereafter). In case we are not able to pay for a month, we can pay within two months. In these five years the account holder is excused four times for defaults of payment of instalment. We can also partly withdraw our savings (about 50% of the balance after one year). About 7.5% is paid as interest every three months. In case we get some additional income and wish to deposit in this account, we can also get a rebate. Using Cheque Book Facilities When we deposit money in our account in a bank, we can withdraw money from our account in many ways. We need to visit the bank and fill in the withdrawal form in which we can fill the details of our account and put our signature and submit along with the passbook to the bank. Bank deducts the amount we wanted from our account and will give us cash. The other way is to use cheques issued by the bank and withdraw money from your account or make payments. Minimum Balance In order to use cheques, we need to maintain a minimum balance in our account. This amount varies with locations we reside and banks. A few banks also provide cheque book facility with zero balance in the account as well. People maintain accounts with cheque book facility so that they do not have to carry much cash when making purchases. Payment of Bills Another advantage of cheque book facility is that if we want to send money to someone, it is safe to send the cheque rather than cash. Banks deal with account with cheque book facility in the following way: Suppose you pay a telephone bill of ` 1500 to MTNL / BSNL by issuing a cheque. The MTNL/BSNL sends your cheque to the bank it has an account with. The bank electronically increases MTNL/BSNL account balance by `",

When we get a confirmation from MTNL / BSNL about our payment, this also means the cheque we issued got cleared. Suppose you do not have sufficient balance in your account, the bank will not honour your cheque and the MTNL / BSNL will return the cheque to you. This is called dishonour of cheque by the bank. As per the bank laws in India, you will be penalised for issuing cheque without having sufficient balance. Keeping track of our money One precaution we need to take while making payments through cheque is to record the amount in our cheque book so that we can always come to know how much money is left in our account. We can also check our balance through the Internet or as shown by the ATM. By keeping track of our account balance, we can make sure that the cheque does not bounce back. When our cheques bounce, we also lose credibility, even if we make payment without looking at our account balance unintentionally.

Whenever we engage in a financial transaction, particularly while making payments through cheques, we need to check with our cheque book transactions and mark off cleared cheques. Let's do some calculation for knowing account balance. Last month Kavita had a cheque book savings account with a balance of ` 5000. This month, she received her salary of ` 7000 to her account. She made payments through cheques totalling ` 7500 and all the cheques got cleared. She did not withdraw any funds from her account. Calculate her balance for this month. ` 5000 + ` 7000 - ` 7500 = ` 4500 Solution: Last month's balance + Deposits - Cheques that cleared New balance We need to be careful while looking at the monthly statement to determine our bank balance. Suppose in a month you had no financial transaction in your account, the balance from your monthly statement should be the same as the balance on your passbook as long as all the cheques you issued got cleared. But if some cheques have not yet been cleared, the balance on your monthly statement will exceed the balance on your account by the amount of the cheques that have not yet been cleared. If you issue more cheques, you will land up in negative balance and cheque bouncing problem. Clearing of Cheques When we issue a cheque, our balance is not reduced until the time the cheque is cleared. The time between issuing a cheque until the money deducted from our account balance is referred to as the cheque float. This float is due to the time it takes for the bank where the cheque was deposited to contact your bank. Sometimes postal / courier delays also lead to delay in making payments. Earlier it used to take 3-15 days for clearing outstation cheques. Suppose you send a cheque from Kolkata to buy a book in Chennai from a book publisher, cheques and requisition form reach Chennai which would take 2-3 days and the cheque has to be deposited to the service branch of your bank in Chennai. All the transactions used to take 10-15 days.

Automated Teller Machines (ATM Cum-Debit Cards Banks also provide their customers digitally made plastic cards popularly known as ATM-cum-debit cards for withdrawing cash from ATMs located in numerous convenient locations in the country. By using ATM card and entering the personal identification number (PIN), banks allow the ATM card holders to withdraw cash 24 hours a day, any day of the year. Banks issue ATM cards with a PIN. Banks suggest changing PIN frequently so that your card cannot be misused by other persons. Banks also collaborate with other banks and credit card companies so that we can withdraw cash from ATMs of collaborating financial institutions or purchase goods and services using ATM cards. However, a limit on the total amount withdrawn in a day has been imposed. For example, in most ATMs in India, we can withdraw upto `. 10, 000 at a time. Also in a day, we can withdraw not more than ` 45,000. In case we wish to withdraw from ATMs other than your bank, we can withdraw ` 45, 000 in a day and up to 5 times in a month.

In India, credit cards are mostly issued by banks and credit card companies. These cards are accepted by most business outlets. Banks honour transactions made on the credit cards. Credit card companies receive a percentage (commonly between 2-4 per cent) of the payments made to business outlets with their credit cards. For example, if you buy a colour television in a shop using Master Card and paid ` 10,000 in a retail shop, that retail shop will pay Master Card a percentage, about ` 200. Even though most retail shops accept credit cards, some shops require this 2 per cent to be paid by customers as they do not wish to incur this cost.

This is also one of the reasons why people do not use credit cards for purchases involving a large amount of money such as buying a house, car and so on. Monthly Statement We will receive a monthly statement in which the details of previous balance, purchases they made with the credit card during that period, cash advances, payments made, finance charge, new balance and the minimum amount we need to pay before the due date. The statement also shows the method of calculating interest rate or finance charge and the detail of various services and charges. How to Apply for a Credit Card When we apply for a credit card, banks require information to assess our ability to repay credit such as our monthly income, monthly expenditure, past history of borrowing and savings and the details of our assets. They expect positive details of all information. However, banks issue credit cards even if some requirements are not satisfactory. For example, for people working in the unorganised sector \u2013 working in private companies, banks extend a limited credit limit and issue credit cards. Some banks require the details of income and existing debt level to assess the existing debt level as a percentage of income. If your debt is only a small fraction of your income, banks provide credit cards. Some banks also extend credit at higher interest rates to individuals who they think have a higher risk of defaulting. Credit card Debt trap People usually don't understand a credit card statement. They wrongly interpret the minimum amount due, taking for granted that they have to pay 5% of the due amount. They never check that the company charges exorbitant interest on the remaining amount.

One disadvantage of these retail cards is that you cannot buy any other materials from other shops which make the general credit cards attractive. Credit cards are also of different types. Some cards known as gold cards or platinum cards provide extra benefit to card holders covering insurance. You will receive upgrade to a gold or platinum card if you prove that you are creditworthy by making more and more purchases and make your credit card payments on time. Credit Limit Banks issuing credit cards set a credit limit which specifies the maximum amount of credit allowed. This limit varies with individuals and is determined by the banks on the basis of creditworthiness of persons applying for credit card. Credit card providers also allow us to make purchase beyond our stated credit limit. This help in preventing situations in which we try to use credit card, but rejected as our maximum credit limit has reached. A separate fee is charged for such purchases. A similar fine is levied if we buy above the credit limit and without availing overdraft protection. Free Credit Period Whenever we make our payments through credit card, credit card companies allow a free credit period in which we are not charged any interest on our purchases. The free credit period is usually about 20-50 days from the time the credit card statement is \"closed\" (any purchases after this date are put on the next month's bill) and the time the bill is due. This shows that credit cards provide us with free credit from the time we made the purchase and the bill is due. However, credit card providers such as SBI allow using the interest free credit period only on retail purchases and if previous month's outstanding balance is paid in full. Credit Card Charges The interest that credit card holders must pay for using credit is called finance charge. It is generally calculated by the simple interest rate on monthly basis and annualised. For example, SBI card Finance Charges for an ordinary credit card is 3.35% p.m. (40.2% p.a.). Purchases after the monthly statement closing date are not normally considered when determining the finance charge because of the free credit period, as they will appear on our next monthly statement. The finance charge applies only to balances that",

Purchases after the monthly statement closing date are not normally considered when determining the finance charge because of the free credit period, as they will appear on our next monthly statement. The finance charge applies only to balances that were not paid in full before their due date in the current billing period. Credit card companies charge an annual fee for using their cards. However, some companies waive this fee depends on a variety of factors. Other Schemes Credit card companies float various schemes to attract people to use their credit cards and on occasions they also waive annual fee. Some companies also offer bonus to card holders by awarding points for each purchase. If credit card holders accumulate a specific number of points, they are offered schemes like free travel to tourist locations and so on. Credit card providers also make a tie up with many business firms and encourage credit card holders to buy goods and services at a discount rate. Some banks also allow us to withdraw a limited amount of cash using credit card through ATMs. There is no free credit period and the interest rate is very high. For example, in SBI cards, if a person has credit limit of say ` 45, 000, the cash limit (as part of credit limit) is ` 18, 000. Out of this cash limit, one can withdraw about ` 12, 000 and ` 15, 000 for gold and platinum cards in a day. A fee called cash advance fee or 2.5 per cent of money if withdrawn from SBI ATMs or ` 300 is charged. The interest charged on cash advances in SBI cards is 3.35% per month (40.2% p.a.). High Interest Rate if Payment is Postponed People also use credit cards as a means of financing their purchases. This means, we can pay only a portion of the credit card bill at the end of the month and the bank extends credit for the remaining period,",

Interest rate charged on credit is relatively high and ranges between 18% to 24% depending on the credit card provider and is calculated on an annualised basis and does not vary much over time. Although it is a convenient way of making payments for those who cannot make payments at one time, it is expensive and should be avoided if possible. Using credit cards \u2013 some precautions (i) When we receive the monthly statement, we need to verify it carefully. There may be some arithmetic error, double charge for a purchase, or an incorrect amount on a purchase. Sometimes a wrong entry might have been included. For example, when you were issued the credit card, you were promised that there would be no annual fee. However, after 2-3 years of use, you may find a monthly statement having included the annual fee in your account. In such cases, we need to immediately contact the bank or credit card company about the new charges debited to your account. Credit card providers also specify duration say, 15 days (SBI card) and locations for jurisdiction for settling our disputes as required by our consumer protection laws. (ii) Due to aggressive marketing strategies, we tend to acquire too many credit cards from different credit card providers. This can complicate record keeping and increase the probability of losing one or more credit cards. It is better to use only one credit card to cover your purchases. In that case, we need to (i) ensure whether the credit card is acceptable to shops in which you use credit card most. MasterCard, Maestro and Visa are accepted by most shops; (ii) look for credit card that does not charge an annual fee and (iii) examine the interest rate / finance charges and other fees and choose a suitable credit card which has low charges and fees. Sometimes, credit card providers charge a very low interest but charge a high annual fee and other charges (for cash advances, late payment, service taxes, changes in the finance charges when late payments are made, fee for accessing credit beyond the maximum limit). Customers need to be cautioned of these hidden costs which the companies do not reveal to them. (iii) You need to do some basic arithmetic before choosing a credit card.",

Sometimes, credit card holders also specify that the low fee or charges are only for a short duration. You need to ask them the details of duration. (iv) The details of free interest period and whether such period is available for cash advances also are to be explored. (v) Use credit card only if you are sure to cover the payment before the end of free interest duration on or before the due date. (vi) Determine the maximum amount of credit you may require each month only after deducting for all your expenditure as well as a specific amount of savings. Activity You plan to apply for a credit card A because it has no annual fee, while credit card B has an annual fee of ` 3000. You typically have an outstanding credit balance ` 10,000 each month. Credit card A charges an annual interest of 40 per cent on balances carried forward, while credit card B charges an interest rate 30 per cent on balances carried forward.

You will not believe that the amount of interest you will earn on any other investment (keeping in savings bank account or invest in term deposits) would always be lower than interest payments you are making for credit cards. It may not be over exaggeration if we say that use savings if necessary to pay the credit card bills on or before the due date. (viii) If you are not able to avoid using credit cards, prioritise yourself that you pay the minimum amount you need to pay on due date. If possible, try to avail low interest loan facilities to pay the credit card debts because the credit card companies levy a variety of charges in such a manner that you will be forced to pay a huge amount in the end. (ix) Use ATM-cum-debit cards as they offer the same convenience of not holding cash but also will put a hold on your spending habits. Using Money Transfer Facilities Banking Banks provide various money transfer facilities. Customers conventionally use banks for making payments through cheques and drafts facilities. Suppose you are residing in Chandigarh and have to send ` 10,000 to your friend in Bangalore. You can go to a bank in Chandigarh, hand over ` 10,000 with a small commission and ask for a bank draft on another bank in Bangalore. The Chandigarh bank writes a draft in favour of your friend in Bangalore directing the bank in Chandigarh to pay him the amount on demand. You can take the draft issued by the bank and post it to your friend in Bangalore. On receipt of it, your friend can submit the draft in the bank in which he has an account. He gets ` 10,000 deposited in his account. Similarly, money can also be transferred from one country to another. Core banking transfer It is another advance facility offered by banks. Suppose you wish to send / transfer money to your uncle having an account in another branch either within the town or city or elsewhere, you can pay the amount in the nearby bank / issue a cheque and request the bank to transfer the money to your uncle. Within a few minutes, your money gets transferred electronically. Some banks charge a small amount for this service and others charge only",

Within a few minutes, your money gets transferred electronically. Some banks charge a small amount for this service and others charge only for large amounts. For example, State Bank of India allows us to transfer about `. 50,000 without any service charges on a day. Other Services People also use draft facilities to pay for various services provided by organisations or for paying institutional fees. Suppose you wish to apply for government job or for taking admission to a course offered by colleges and universities run by governments, people pay the required amount to the bank and get drafts and apply. When you apply for a draft for paying outside the city or town you are residing, it is called draft. For making payments within the city, banks issue banker's cheques. Similar services are also offered by post offices also. It is known as postal orders. Suppose you want to apply for a job in a central government office, you can ask for postal orders for the specific amount. Post offices have a printed postal order for specific amount. You can retain the counterfoil and send the postal order along with application form. Post Office Post offices also offer similar services. You are aware that you can send your money through money order. One advantage of money order is that you do not need to post anything as in the case of drafts. Post offices take the responsibility of paying the money to the payee and also the message you wish to pass on. These days, post offices allow us to know the status of money orders that we sent through telephone and the Internet facilities.

One suggestion is that for making large payments beyond ` 1000, we should use draft facilities and for lesser amounts we can use money order facilities. Internet and Mobile Banking Going to post offices and banks and requesting their banking services to send or transfer money generally require sufficient time. Technological advancements provide a lot of options today. One latest option is the Internet banking. Suppose you have a savings / current account, you can approach your bank. After completing the formalities required by the bank, you will be issued two secret codes \u2013 a username and a password. Using these details, you can transfer your money or receive money from others electronically using computer and the Internet. You can also use this facility to pay your bills. For example, if you wish to pay for electricity, you can pay through the Internet banking facilities. The Internet banking allows you to check your account balance, view your account, request for a cheque book, drafts, banker's cheques, and give instructions to stop cheque payment. We can also give instructions such as request for third party transfers, invest and renew term deposits. However, you need to take certain precautions while using these facilities. For example, you should not divulge the details of username and password to others (see box). Banks provide all such precautions when we approach them to avail this facility. Very recently, banks also enable us to use cell phones for money transfer and other services. Using the Internet Banking: Some Precautions 1. Access your bank website only by typing the URL in the address bar of your browser. 2. Do not click on any links in any e-mail message to access the site. Most banks including State Bank of India never send e-mail and embedded links asking you to update or verify personal, confidential and security details. NEVER RESPOND to such e- mails/phone calls/SMS if you receive. 3. Do not be lured if you receive an e-mail/SMS/phone call promising reward for providing your personal information or for updating your account details in the bank website. 4. Scan your computer regularly with Antivirus to ensure that the system is Virus/Trojan free. 5. Change your Internet Banking password at periodical intervals. 6. Always check the last",

All these could be misused by persons other than the card holder. To prevent this, the RBI directed in August 2009 that an additional level of security be provided for online payments. Visa and MasterCard offer facilities termed Verified by Visa (VBV) and Secure Code respectively. This can be done when you use your card to make online payment by contacting the registered merchant establishments. The list of member- establishments is available at / verified or .

The financial institution should be located close to your residence or workplace. You also have to see its ATM network. It should provide all the banking services you require in the long and short term. Sometimes, you may not have the Internet facilities. You need to see whether you are able to do most financial transactions without modern gadgets such as computers and the Internet. You are aware that interest rates offered on deposits vary with banks. Depending on your financial position, you will have to do some arithmetic to estimate your income earned from interest rates. You may also need to borrow from your financial institution. You have to see whether they provide loans to their customers with low interest or not. Many banks do not operate physical branches all over the city. They may deal mostly with ATM counters and through the Internet. They may also tend to pay a higher interest rate on deposits than institutions with physical branches because they have lower expenses and can afford to pay higher deposit rates. We must weigh the trade-off between high deposit rates and other facilities at these financial institutions. Banks and post offices charge fees for various services. For example, if you issue cheques beyond the free-limit, you will have to pay a fee for additional cheques issued. Similarly, commission for making demand drafts and core transfers also vary with banks. Choose the one which charges you a low fee. We need to read all the instructions given when we deal with a banking service, whether it is with credit card, ATM card, or any other deposits. Reading the instructions carefully and enquiring from the staff of financial institutions can help us to understand and benefits of their services better.

    "text": "29 CHAPTER 4 Personal assets represent items of utility or comfort which people purchase, as they earn, usually over their lifetime. They are different from items of daily use such as food items, cosmetics, clothes, etc., because they usually last for a much longer period of time, and the owner does not have to replace them frequently. The same is not the case with items like a toothbrush, or a t-shirt \u2013 they wear out soon. However, personal assets also tend to be much more expensive than items of daily use \u2013 good examples of such are a house, a piece of land, a car, an expensive computer, etc. The purchaser of personal assets may need to seek financial help to arrange money to complete the purchase. We will discuss the types of financial help available to people to complete the purchase of various types of personal assets. Loan If you plan to buy an asset, you may seek a loan from a bank or a financial institution (called 'lenders') against the security of the asset. The loan is provided at the time of purchase and it can be repaid over a period of time through instalments. The security of the assets means that the lender can seize the asset in case you fail to pay the loan back, either partly or completely \u2013 this is called 'default'. In case of you 'defaulting', the lender can retrieve the lent money by selling the asset. FINANCING ASSETS",

    "text": "30 Applying for a loan While applying for a loan, you need to provide information about your personal financial position to the lender to show your ability to repay the loan. Your personal financial position means a record of the assets you already own, the debts you owe to other people or lenders, and your monthly/ annual income and expenses. A loan contract is made between you and the lender which specifies the amount of loan, the rate of interest, the repayment schedule, maturity time and the collateral (security of an asset to back the loan). Mostly, the asset to be purchased serves as security to the lender. If you buy a house on loan, and do not repay the loan, the lender can seize the house and sell it to recover the money lent to you. Repayment of loan EMIs or Equated Monthly Instalments are used, in most cases, to repay loans taken to finance personal assets. EMIs are calculated in such a manner that the same amount is payable by the borrower to the lender every month over the tenure of the loan, and by the time the last EMI is made, the entire loan amount is repaid. The critical thing about understanding EMIs is that this amount captures both the repayment of the loan principal, as well as the loan interest. Managing your personal finances well is the key to leading a secure life. You must always correctly estimate the amount of assets you can purchase, and also keep a check on your expenses. Losing track of these and over-estimating your purchasing capacity, say by taking a loan, for which EMI payments are more than what you can bear, could lead you into financial troubles. Education Loan Acquisition of any type of asset requires money. If you do not have the entire quantum of funds required to obtain the desired asset, you turn to financial institutions, mostly banks, which provide funding in the form of loans. Human resources are a part of the social capital of a country. Why Education loan? Education creates academic and professional skills and knowledge in human beings, thereby creating human capital. People use such skills to gain employment and generate income for themselves. Thus, it is important that no deserving student is denied education for want of funds.

The objective of these loans is to bring education within the reach of students and help them improve their future prospects. Amount The loan amount ranges from ` 1 lakh to 10 lakh. The foremost criteria for obtaining an education loan is that one must have secured admission to a general / technical course in India or abroad. It is generally provided to people within the age group of 16-26 years. Composition: What does it include? Education loans may cover apart from the tuition fee, a list of other expenses like boarding costs, costs of books/stationary, and other ancillary expenses. The entire cost incurred to complete the course is not financed by the bank. A certain portion, called margin, has to be paid by the applicant as his own contribution. If the loan amount exceeds ` 4 lakh, you are required to pay 5 per cent of the amount as margin money. It means if you want a loan of ` 5 lakh, you are required to pay ` 25,000/-, the rest will be paid by the bank.

A processing fee is usually charged by the loan granting institution, which has to be either paid separately by the applicant, or is deducted from the amount disbursed as loan. Repayment of loan The repayment has to begin immediately after the student secures employment or six months post the completion of course, whichever is earlier. The repayment tenure is between 5 to 7 years repaying the amount (student or co-borrower) can claim a tax deduction on interest paid on this loan under section 80E. Case Study Rahul needs admission in ABC College which has a total fee of ` 5,00,000 for a 5-year course. His father has ` 1,00,000 cash in a fixed deposit account which, if and as required, can be spared for his son's admission to the college. However, the balance amount needs to be funded through a loan from a bank. Rahul has the option to approach any of the five banks as shown in the table. The choice of bank from which Rahul will take loan will depend on the terms and conditions on which the loan is given by each bank. These are shown in the table. Major conditions to be noted are: (I) Rate of interest on loan Education Loan Interest rates on education loans in India range from 10-13% per annum, depending on factors including the lending bank, loan amount and collateral offered. For female students , most banks offer a concession on 5100 basis points in interest rates. Repayment has to start 6 months after the completion of the course, whichever is earlier. The repayment period ranges from 5-7 years. Deduction from income tax payable can be claimed under section 80E on the interest paid.

Rate of interest and period of repayment First, Rahul will look at the rate of interest and the period of repayment of loan. Usually, if the rate of interest is lower and the period of repayment is longer, the cost of the loan is lower. In this particular case, the period of repayment of all loans is the same. Hence, this is not a consideration, and Rahul will be guided by the rate of interest alone. Margin money However, in making his choice, Rahul should also consider the fact that he will save money if he is not required to give margin money. In case of the Great Bank, savings of Rahul's father will not be used as margin money and thus will earn interest on his fixed deposit. This income will reduce the total cost of the loan for him. Interest lost on fixed deposit In case of the Earth Bank which requires margin money, Rahul's father will have to lose his fixed deposit in order to pay the margin money. Thus, he will lose interest on the fixed deposit. The total cost of the loan should therefore include the interest lost on the fixed deposit in this case. Equated monthly instalment Rahul will also need to know the amount of EMI before deciding on the loan as the EMI is linked to his father's capacity to repay the loan. If the EMI is very high for his father's monthly income, Rahul will find it difficult to service the loan over the long term. He will have to choose the loan with lower EMI. Thus, the choice of loan to be obtained by Rahul from any bank will depend on all the above considerations.

When you decide to purchase a car, the first thing you have to do decide is your budget and make an effort to stay within the budget. The next thing is about the size and brand of the car and make a list of the selected cars. You have to decide whether you want a petrol car, a diesel or a CNG car. You have to see how much total mileage the cars give per litre of petrol. Certain other factors also have to be considered, such as insurance charges, repair charges and resale value of the car. These factors differ in case of different cars. You can find out these details either by newspapers/the Internet or through car dealers directly. You can also discuss with your friends and relatives who own the cars which you plan to buy Negotiating the price Some of the car dealers negotiate prices, although this is not common. Also, in course of the negotiation, the dealer may offer you free insurance for 1-2 years, free music system and interiors at reduced prices. These features are priced at a higher than market price to make you feel that you are getting a good deal. Car loans In most of the cases, the organization you are working with also provides loans to their employees. There are a few standard types of car loans available in India. You can choose the one which suits your repayment capacity. Margin money scheme Here the customers are required to pay only the margin amount of money, i.e., 10 or 20 per cent of the total cost of the car along with the first instalment of EMI. The balance amount is paid through post-dated cheques. This is",

    "text": "34 Security deposit scheme The consumers are required to deposit a particular amount of money as security deposit against the amount provided as loan. The EMI under this scheme is normally higher than other schemes. However, the security deposit also earns an interest and is returned after the maturity of loan to the buyer. Hire-purchase scheme Under this scheme an agreement is made between the owner of the car (the 'asset') and the user of the car for its hiring. The agreement is made in such a way that the hirer of the car has the option of purchasing the car in accordance with the terms of the agreement. This scheme is offered by non-banking financial institutions. Financing plan Once you decide a particular car, you should estimate the monthly repayment of the loan you may take to finance the car. For example, Anita plans to buy a car. She has shortlisted two cars, one costs ` 5,85,000.00 and the other costs ` 4,75,000.00. She has to decide the amount of down payment and the amount of loan. She has to make a comparison between some of the cars shortlisted by her. Down Payment and Loan Amount ` 5,85,000.00 ` 4,75,000.00 ` 1,35,000.00 ` 1,75,000.00 ` 4,50,000.00 ` 3,00,000.00 Car I Car II Purchase Price Down Payment (out of savings) Loan Amount needed Now she can compare between these two cars. After the decision is taken, she has to compare her monthly instalments for both the cars. Suppose she gets the car loan at an annual rate of interest of 9 per cent, she has to calculate how much monthly payment is required on EMI basis to repay the loan over 3 years, 4 years or 5 years. For this, she will do the following comparative analysis. Monthly Loan Payments on EMI basis @ 9% rate of interest per annum Loan maturity 4,50,000.00 3,00,000.00 36 months (3 years) 14,310.00 9,540.00 48 months (4 years) 11,199.00 7,466.00 60 months (5 years) 9,342.00 6,228.00 Loan Amount ( ` ) Car II Anita notices that the amount of monthly repayment decreases if she extends her loan period. If she borrows ` 4,50,000.00, her EMI will be ` 14,310.00 for a three-year loan, ` 11,199.00 for a four-year loan and ` 9,342.00 for a five-year loan.

    "text": "35 Purchasing a House If you plan to buy a house, you have to take into account certain financial considerations: Affordability It is advisable to be within your purchasing capacity and avoid purchasing a house that is not affordable. Financial planners suggest that the price of the house should be not more than double the gross annual income of the purchaser. Similarly, the monthly household debt payment (including the loan taken to purchase the house) should be no more than about 40 per cent of total monthly gross income. Insurance If you choose to buy insurance on your house, then a bigger and costlier house requires high insurance than a smaller one as it costs more to replace parts of the house that are damaged. Taxes Taxes are imposed on houses to pay for local services like park, school, etc, in the vicinity. The taxes are calculated annually and they range between 1-2 per cent of the market value of the house. Resale value Many people buy a house with a plan to sell it after a few years. The resale value depends on the location of the house. You can calculate the resale value by knowing the value of similar properties in that location that were sold a short while ago. Resale of houses also involves a commission that is usually 2 per cent of the selling price and is shared equally by buyers and sellers. Price approximation On the basis of the above-mentioned considerations, you may shortlist three or four desirable properties which match with your preferences. In order to estimate the average price of a house in your preferred location, the below mentioned calculation can provide a good guidance: Suppose you want to purchase a home with an area of 1,100 sq. ft. You have shortlisted 4 houses of your choice in your preferred location, and also have the price and size of each \u2013 Price per sq. ft ( ` ) Size (Sq. ft) Price ( ` ) 1200 1000 900 800 60,00,000 48,00,000 42,30,000 30,00,000 60,00,000/1200=5000 48,00,000/1000=4800 42,30,000/900=4700 30,00,000/800=4500 Based on these prices, you can calculate/assess the average price of the house based on the price per square feet. This would approximately be ` (5000+4800+4700+4500)/4 = ` 4750. Since your requirement is for a house having a size of 1,100 sq. ft, its market value will be average price per sq. ft multiplied with area",

The seller may accept your offer or reject it or may tell you to revise it. After negotiations, the seller may lower the price but you may find it still higher than you are prepared to pay. Now, it depends on you whether you accept it, reject it or request the seller to further lower it. This goes on until the seller and you come to an agreement. In case you negotiate hard and are able to convince the seller, the final price may be agreed at a point somewhere in between the average price (assessed by you on the basis of average price) or the price offered by the seller. Hidden Price! Your dream house may come at a hidden price. Before you work the maths for buying your precious house, make sure that you have done enough homework and have sufficient funds to pay for 'extra' costs. Apart from the cost of the property in question, which is calculated as price per square feet, the cost of the house may actually turn out to be higher. The first additional cost the buyer will incur is stamp duty. Since most properties in India are bought through home loans, one has to consider the cost of the insurance policy to cover the home loan, which may add up to a sizable amount. Further, society charges towards maintenance and a yearly property tax are other costs that most buyers do not consider prior to purchase. In some of the housing societies, a number of facilities such as swimming pools, gymnasium, community centres, landscaped garden also involve all time additional cost. If you are buying a resale property you should check about the outstanding registration cost. It is advisable to negotiate with the seller and ensure that he bears the registration cost before you buy the house.

Source: The Economic Times Mortgage Loan A mortgage loan, in simple terms, is a loan given to consumers to purchase a house \u2013 it allows the lender to take possession of the house in case the borrower defaults, and sell it to recover the lent money. A mortgage is a legal agreement which assigns the ownership of the house to the bank or lender till the loan is fully repaid. Since this legal agreement (or mortgage) is an inherent part of the loan sanctioning procedure by banks or lenders, such loans are called mortgage loans. In a mortgage loan, usually the bank expects you to cover a portion of the total price with your own money, which is known as 'down payment', and is usually 10-20 percent of the total price. Lenders (banks or financial institutions) give mortgage loans at different rates of interest. You should obtain a mortgage loan that has a low interest rate, as this will help keep the monthly instalments lower than those paid at high interest rate mortgage loan. The maturity period of mortgage indicates the duration by the end of which you will be required to pay off the loan. Shorter maturity period mortgages loans have higher monthly instalments, but also help in reducing the interest paid on the loan and, in turn, the total amount of repayment. The benefit of longer duration loans is that you have smaller monthly instalments and you have more cash available on hand with you. If the cost of house of your choice is ` 52,25,000. You make a down payment of the total amount of loan, i.e., ` 5,22,500 (10% of the price) out of your own savings. You need a loan of ` 47,02,500 from the bank at",

Allocation of Repayment between Principal and Interest You have taken ` 47,02,500 as loan on 9.5% interest rate. The table below shows how your loan payment is allocated between principal and the interest payment each year. You will notice how the initial payments are allocated mostly to interest payment with a relatively small amount used to pay off the principal. For example, in the second year, the total interest payment is ` 4, 34,975 and the principal amount paid is ` 91,027. Thus initially most of your payment is needed to cover the interest owed. As time passes, the proportion of payment allocated to the principal increases and interest payment decreases.

Do you know what this premium is and how it is determined? How does insurance actually help? Let us assume that there is a colony which has 1000 houses valued at ` 15,00,000 each. All these owners need to protect their property against uncertainties like fire, theft or any other damage to the house. They pay a certain amount say ` 10,000 as premium to an insurance company to protect themselves against any loss. The insurance company, thus, pools the amount paid as premium by the owners and assures them that it would compensate the house owners in case of any loss by fire, theft etc. The owners benefit by such an arrangement as by paying a sum of ` 10,000 annually, they are now assured of protection against risks or uncertainties since they will be compensated by the insurance company. The insurance company will pay the amount from the premiums which it had charged from the owners. In case there is fire, the owners who have got their property insured and paid the premium on time will be compensated by the insurance company. In this manner, the economic burden is shared by all the house owners in the colony. Since all the house owners are contributing premiums, the insurance company is PROTECTION OF ASSETS",

The probability that all the houses will be on fire is very remote, hence the insurance company also benefits by this agreement and the owners too are assured in exchange for a premium. This means if the risk is higher the insurance company will charge a higher premium. There is also a chance that some owners may refuse to contribute to compensate the victim. The insurance company then needs to collect funds in advance to meet the loss. This will require some calculations on the basis of past experience to estimate the amount of loss. Here, it is presumed that 2 out of 1000 houses may burn or bear loss annually. This also means that contributions made by the landowners annually may increase to ` 15,000. The increased sum will meet the cost of loss as well as other expenses incurred in the operation of the programme. By paying a certain amount as premium, the owner is protected against the risk of uncertainty. In insurance, we can say, the risk is transferred or shifted from one person to a group (i.e., all the owners) and a person's loss is shared by all the members of the group. From the above example we can say that insurance is a protective device to one's health and property. In this case the individual incurs a certain cost (the premium) for a large uncertain financial loss (the contingency insured against) that would exist if there were no insurance. Can you manage risk in life? When any individual buys insurance, he/she transfers a portion of risk for compensation to the insurance company. The company in turn provides him/ her protection at a price, but it's a fraction of recurring expense borne by you annually. It is true that events cannot be predicted but the probability of events occurring can be calculated on the basis of past experience. Henceforth, steps need to be taken to reduce the chance or extent of loss to one's health and property. For example, the use of seat belt in the car can reduce the chance of auto injuries and deaths. Therefore, we buy an insurance policy and we transfer the risk to the insurance company in exchange for a fee called premium. Nature of Insurance Insurance is a cooperative",

Nature of Insurance Insurance is a cooperative device under which a group of persons who agree to share the financial loss to either of them may be brought together voluntarily by a registered company. These companies are called insurers and are the risk bearers. They provide insurance to the customer / client who are called the insured. The risk is evaluated by the insurer and an amount is charged from the insured. This amount is called the premium. The insurance companies provide insurance policies. These policies are legally binding contracts between the insurer and the insured. The insured or the policy holders pay insurance premium to the insurance company for sharing the risk. Insurance provides security and safety to an individual and guarantees payment in the time of loss. It ensures compensation for losses suffered due to the incident on unanticipated events.

    "text": "42 Elements of Insurable Risks It is not feasible for an insurance company to ensure all kinds of loss, rather few elements of loss can be insured at a reasonable price. In fact, insurers are not willing to accept all the risk that client may wish to transfer to them. Certain characteristics should exist to be considered as a proper subject for insurance. For example: (i) The loss produced by the risk must be definite and measurable (ii) The loss must be fortuitous or accidental (iii) The loss must not be catastrophic What the customer expects? The customer expects information on different products, i.e., policies, their terms and conditions (grace, waiting periods, and exclusions). The customer may desire that particular insurance policy should be linked to her needs. For example, a parent who is worried about the future of her child would prefer educational loan to retirement policy. There should be active involvement of the company at the times of settlement of claims. There should also be regular contact with the company to dispatch payment to the customer when policy matures or to ensure payments in times of emergency. The company should make effort to instantly dispatch policy document, health card and other claim settlements. Functions of Insurance The purpose of insurance is generally to protect the insured against uncertainties. Certainty Insurers reduce the uncertainty of loss and the insured is given guarantee of payment at the time of loss or damage. Protection The insured is assured of protection from probable chance of accident or loss. Assist in capital formation The accumulated funds in the form of premium are invested in various income generating schemes. Prevention of loss Insurance does not eliminate or decrease the uncertainty for the individual as to whether or not the event will occur, but it will reduce the extent of financial loss connected with the event. Insurance provides security and safety The insurance provides safety and security against the premature death of a family member or payment at the time of old age. Similarly, the property can also be insured so as to provide security to the owner against damage or loss in a fire.

The amount of the policy will depend upon a number of factors. Need for minimum protection The amount of insurance that any client should purchase depends upon the analysis of the needs that would have to be met by dependents when the family earner dies. In this case there is a need to follow three steps \u2013 first to identify the basic needs that would have to be met after the death of an individual. Second, resources available to meet these needs must be sorted out. Last, the difference between the existing needs and available resources which needs to be fulfilled has to be identified. Current income level Payment of premium results in an outflow of disposable income. While deciding for insurance, one should keep in the mind the regular payment of insurance premium. Tax benefits The tax benefits under Section 80 C can be availed on purchase of different insurance policies. Individuals can avail tax benefits by paying life insurance premium according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act.

Present age Life insurance requires a periodical review based on individual needs in order to ensure that the coverage is adequate. One can buy more insurance policies for the same premium at a younger age than at an older age. At a younger age you can undertake risks since you have ample time to check your decision. The payment of premium is spread over a longer duration of time compared to policies opted at later stage in life. However, at this stage you should minimise the risk and opt for safe policies.

    "text": "Types of insurance: Life Insurance, Health, Home and Auto There are many types of insurance such as life insurance, health, home and auto insurance. Life insurance covers the risk of unexpected death. Health insurance meets the need of expensive medical treatment. Similarly, home insurance covers the risk on burning of the house or when there is robbery in the house. In the same fashion car insurance covers the risk of an accident. Whole- life Policies A whole-life policy is one that covers the insured for almost all his life. Under this type of policy, the premium is payable throughout the life of the insured person. The policy amount is paid to the beneficiary upon the death of the policy holder. Due to its long duration, the premiums may be low. The policy matures after a fixed period since the insurance cover ceases to exist and the insured amount is then paid to the policy holder. As an investor in life insurance policy how much would you like to invest? What other factors would you consider before opting for a policy? Life insurance: How to estimate your insurance needs ? In the event of any misfortune, a policy can save the family from financial hardships. Therefore, it becomes essential to estimate the amount of life insurance required to meet exigencies. Guidelines to estimate insurance needs Income Rule It states that individual cover should be around six to eight times of the customer's gross annual income. For example, a person earning a gross annual income of ` 1,00,000 should have between ` 6,00,000 (6 \u00d7 1,00,000) or ` 8,00,000 (8 \u00d7 1,00,000) in life insurance cover. Income plus Expenses Rule This rule indicates that individual insurance need to be equal to five times your gross annual income plus the total of basic expenses like housing or car loans, personal debt, child's education, etc. 46 Life insurance is also considered an investment. However, before opting for a policy some factors like The company's financial strength and integrity, terms and conditions of the policy needs to be carefully looked into. One may choose from a variety of policies to suit one's needs. Stages of life Needs Assets Initial stage. No responsibility Premature death leads to minimal needs No worthwhile assets Married, with children Premature death leads to financial hardships Growing assets Empty nest The needs decline once children are settled Strong asset base Source;",

    "text": "47 Premiums as Percentage of Income In this case, payment of insurance premiums depends on disposable income. One should decide the quantum of insurance after meeting the regular outflows from the salary. Family Need Approach Under this rule, one has to divide family needs into two main categories: immediate needs at death (cash needs), and ongoing needs (net income needs). The amount of insurance should cover the immediate and ongoing needs of the family. An agent should not influence your decision since you are already aware of how to calculate the amount of insurance required. Your agent may try and convince you that an insurance scheme has the feature of a saving plan as well as an investment plan. However, since the rate of return on a policy is generally low, it cannot be compared with a saving scheme of a bank or any investment plan. A saving or investment plan may fetch you much higher returns than what you would get on an insurance policy. The purpose of insurance is only to assure your life, health or property against risks. Health Insurance Schemes It is also called accident insurance, sickness insurance and disability insurance. It provides risk coverage against unforeseen health expenses that may result in financial hardship. Health insurance schemes also cover outpatient department (OPD) expenses for illness, injuries and women during pregnancy and childbirth. Health insurance is a critical component of financial planning. It means an individual or group is purchasing health care coverage in advance by paying a fee called 'premium'. It is an arrangement that helps to defer, delay, reduce or altogether avoid payment for health care incurred by individuals and households. It is expensive but at the same time necessary. It ensures medical care and limits potential liabilities. Its need is felt more in old age. People's lifespan in general, has increased, partly due to effective health care and medical facilities available. This facility is provided by both private insurance companies as well as by the government. The existing health schemes can be categorized as: a) Voluntary health insurance scheme or private-for-profit schemes b) Employer-based schemes c) Insurance offered by NGO's/ community based health insurance d) Mandatory health insurance schemes or government run schemes (namely ESIS, CGHS ) \u25aa Can take loan on your policy \u25aa Keep your parents well informed regarding policies \u25aa Surrender your policy at the right time \u25aa Buy adequate",

The scheme operates in collaboration with the National Insurance Corporation (NIC). Under SEWA's (Self Employed Women's Association) there is a policy which has a low premium per individual and is paid by the women for life, health and assets insurance. At an additional payment, her husband too can be covered. In addition, some amount per member is also paid to the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) which provides coverage to a maximum of ` 2000 per person per year for hospitalization. After being hospitalized at a hospital of one\u2019s choice (public or private), the insurance claim is submitted to SEWA. The responsibility for enrolment of members, for processing and approving of claims rests with SEWA. NIC in turn receives premium from SEWA annually and pays them a lumpsome on a monthly basis for all claims reimbursed. Social Insurance or Mandatory Health Insurance Scheme or Government Run Schemes (namely, ESIS, CGHS) Social insurance is an earmarked fund set up by the government with explicit benefits in return for payment. It is usually compulsory for certain groups in the population and the premiums are determined by income (and hence ability to pay) rather than related to health risk. The benefits packages are standardized and contributions are earmarked for spending on health services. The government run schemes include the Central Government Health scheme (CGHS) and the Employer State Insurance Scheme (ESIS).

Pre-existing condition A policy may exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, which existed with the individual prior to the grant of policy. Cancellation operation A health insurance contract may allow the insurance company to cancel the contract at any time. Other contracts guarantee continuous coverage as long as the policy holders pay premium on time. Medical claim It provides for reimbursement of hospitalisation expenses incurred for illness/ diseases or injury sustained. Disability Insurance The disability insurance policy will provide benefits if you are unable to do the duties required of your occupation. Types of Disability Insurance Individual disability insurance The insurance premium varies with the type of job. For example, workers employed in any steel plants are more at risk than any individual working in office building. Employer disability insurance Employers at some firms are either provided the insurance free (fee borne by the firm) or participate in a plan by paying for the coverage. Insurance from Worker's compensation In case of disability, one may receive workman's compensation from the company or organization. Home owner's insurance One of the easier ways of acquiring a house property is through a loan provided under various insurance schemes, where a life insurance policy is accepted as a collateral security. The proceeds of the policy can be adjusted towards the housing loan. It ensures protection in case of theft, damage to the property, personal liability relating to home ownership. Financial loss to the ownership of a house can also occur from a wide variety of adverse events like flood and earthquake. In case of damage or loss of the property, the insured has to produce proof of the loss. Therefore, the insured must notify the loss to the police and register a first information report (FIR). The insurance company under the India Home Insurance policies, provides its customers with instant home insurance quotes. Some of the factors which cover home insurance include area of the house (sq. ft), location of property, approximate rate of construction (`./sq. ft) and type of construction (only pukka/ permanent). However, 50 years and above old properties are exempt from insurance cover. According to the sum insured the customer has to pay the premium for every month/quarter/six months.

For example, if any home entertainment system is priced at ` 5,000 and is assumed to have a life of five years. Let us assume it has been used for half of its life.

After completing the table, you can take pictures of individual items or audiotape/ videotape all the items for further documentation if you wish to insure you assets. Factors that affect home/house owner's insurance premiums Value of insured house Since the value of the house is taken into account, therefore, premium is higher for expensive ones. Deductible A higher deductible reduces the amount of coverage provided by the home/house owner's insurance, and therefore results in lower insurance premium. Location The chances of damage vary from area to area. It is high for coastal areas than for the houses located in the plains. Degree of protection Protection against natural calamities like flood or earthquake require a higher premium. Discounts Discounts are provided to the insurer if other insurance (such as auto, health) is purchased from the same insurance company.

The insurance company only allows persons having insurable interest in the subject matter to opt for a fire insurance policy. i) A person has insurable interest in the property he owns. ii) A businessman has insurable interest in his stock, plant and machinery and building. iii) Partner has insurable interest in the property of partnership firm. iv) Mortgage has insurable interest in the property, which is mortgaged. It is important to define insurable interest since the company has to pay compensation to the policy holder. Motor Insurance Motor insurance has been classified according to types of vehicles i.e., scooter/motor cycles, private cars, commercial vehicles and other vehicles. No motor vehicle can run in a public place unless it is insured against third party liability. Motor insurance is a mandatory requirement for all vehicles owners whether needed for personal and commercial uses. The premium varies from car to car like costly car has high premium and cheap car has lesser rate of the premium. The claims offered by the car insurance company in India can be categorized as a) Accidental claims, b) theft or burglary claims and c) third party claims. Auto insurance provides protection against damage to an automobile and expenses associated with accidents. The policy specifies the coverage provided by an insurance company for a particular individual or a vehicle. In this way, it protects the vehicle and also limits potential liabilities (expenses due to accidents). The rates of premium vary substantially among locations, insurance companies and even among the policy holders. Factors that affect motor insurance premium Insurance policy is determined by the claims an insurer submits to the company. An auto insurance premium will be higher for a policy that specifies a greater amount of liability coverage and lower deductible. Coverage offered by motor insurance companies in India In case of motor insurance the liability incurred is in respect of : \u25aa Death or personal injury to owner of the goods or his authorised representative in goods vehicle. \u25aa Liability insured in respect of death or bodily injury of any passenger of a public service vehicle. \u25aa Liability arising under Workman Compensation Act, 1923 in respect of death or bodily injury of: i) Paid driver in a vehicle ii) Conductor or ticket examiner in a public service vehicle iii) Workers carried in a goods vehicle",

If You Are In an Auto Accident In case of an auto accident, contact the police immediately. You may also note down licence plate numbers from witnesses, if the other driver leaves before the arrival of the police. If possible take pictures of any evidence that may prove that you are not at fault. Write down the details of the accident. After the arrival of police ask for the police report. File a complaint with the insurance company immediately. The company will examine the police report and may also contact the witnesses. An agent employed by the insurance company may investigate the details of the accident. He will survey the site and the automobile and assess the damages to determine the amount of compensation paid by the insurance company. Hit-and-run accidents In hit-and-run accidents the insurance companies are not held liable since the vehicle which has hit the victim cannot be traced. The victim can be compensated by the solatium fund established by the government. The comprehensive auto insurance policy provides for damage caused to the vehicle due to man-made or natural calamities. Renewal of Auto Insurance If a vehicle's auto insurance policy is not renewed, driving that vehicle is illegal. Also if the vehicle meets an accident the insurance company will not pay any claims. No claim bonus will be forfeited. Auto insurance can be renewed with another insurer, including the bonus at your earlier insurer. Insurance sector plays a vital role in the process of economic development of the country also. The process of capital formation is encouraged by the insurance services. The sector acts as mobiliser of savings, as financial intermediary, as promoter of investment activities, as stabilizer of financial market, and as risk manager. Insurance services lead to efficient and productive allocation of capital resources, prevent the losses to the firms by encouraging loss preventive measures, facilitate growth of trade and commerce, complement government social security programmes and assist the individual and firms in efficient management of the risks. In turn, economic development also facilitates reach of insurance both in terms of its dispersion and concentration. 53",

These are considered safe investments as returns are guaranteed by the bank. Other safe investments are provident fund, public provident fund, saving schemes in post offices, etc. There are many other avenues for investment which may give higher returns than banks. Of course, the risks will also increase as higher returns are expected. For this, you may invest in shares and debentures of a company, mutual funds, bonds and other investment plans. These are generally known as financial products. Mutual funds are of various types and investment in them can be tailored to suit your requirements. We shall learn about this and other financial products in this section. Why Invest? When we have surplus money, we think about investing it in something which gives us good return. We may start on our business if we are enterprising, and willing to undertake risk. In this case, we are using our surplus money or funding a business and expect to earn a good return.

If we do not have enough information about the stock exchange operations then we may consult a financial advisor for investment in other financial products like government bonds, mutual funds, etc. Saving money in an almirah is not an investment. However, saving money in a bank is an investment as it assures some return on your investment. Investor buys the shares of a particular company in expectation of earning a better return in terms of appreciation in the market price of the share. Similarly, when an investor subscribes to the debentures of a company, he expects a fixed interest return for a given period. When a person invests in a house he either plans for his own stay or to earn some rental income. Investment in insurance assures security as well as minimum return to the insurers. The basic objective of any investment is to minimize risk and maximize the expected returns besides ensuring stability, liquidity and tax benefits. Today managing one's investment has become challenging and complex. Due to new economic and political situations, stock markets across the globe witness unprecedented volatility. Domestic markets, too, have been integrated with the global markets ever since the boom in technology. Therefore, investment in different types of products in one's portfolio at this juncture would be beneficial to any individual in many ways. Investors in general spend a lot of time deciding about a financial product. In India, investors prefer to invest in secured debt products that guarantees return from it. Therefore, banks fixed deposits or saving deposits form one of the biggest components of investment. Be it a share or a mutual fund, they are looking for returns and checking whether it is beating the benchmark indices. This kind of haphazard investment is not recommended. A financial advisor would want investors to set their goals and accordingly decide the different products/assets to include in their portfolio.

They have three-year-old daughter and two-year-old son. On analysing Rohit's investment plan, it has been found that they had heavy bias towards investment in real estate. The couple had been investing money in two bulky loans undertaken to purchase a house. Their investment approach has not only jeopardized the fulfilment of their financial goal but also indicates concentration of funds in one asset, i.e., real estate. There is no dearth of funds with the family. Insufficient surplus is not the issue rather the couple needs to be apprised regarding diversification or allocation of assets. The financial planner never advises to put all the eggs in one basket. Investment in different assets is based on the notion that even when there is a fluctuation in some assets (in terms of up and down movement in an economy) one is assured of consistent average return from one's portfolio. It is, therefore, advisable to distribute one's investment in other forms of assets like gold, mutual fund, equity, real estate and so on. In this case we find the couple has no investment in equities. Apart from mandatory employee provident fund, they have no debt cushion. What will happen if there is burst in the price of real estate? The volatility in interest rate may reduce the credibility of real estate. Further, real estate is a highly illiquid asset and there is maintenance costs associated with it.",

Let us analyse Varma's investment decisions in real estate Advantages associated with Varma\u2019s investment Disadvantages associated with Varma's investment Investment in real estate Investment at an early stage No investment in equities No debt cushion No insurance policies Relevance of allocation in different assets: Why are we investing in particular financial products. What are our expectations from that investment? Safety A well functioning system helps people reduce their exposure to risks. For example, you expect to earn 15% rate of return on your investment but in actual you earn only 12% thus you fail to minimize your risk. Safety is an important factor to consider while allocating funds to assets. Liquidity Liquidity is conversion of your assets into cash. Investment of funds in some securities may provide high return after a fixed period of time. In the meantime if you need cash, buyers may not be available as they may be infrequently traded shares. Here you may have to compromise by selling at a lower price. We see, that this share was not easily converted into cash and hence not so liquid. However, there are other assets which are considered to be more liquid and may be converted into cash when required. Thus, our portfolio should consist of different kinds of assets. Tax Benefits Investors plan their investment in such a way so that they can avail tax incentives on the given investment opportunities. For example., if an investor invests his money in National Saving Certificate (NSC), he would be entitled for tax rebate u/s 80-c of the Income tax Act, 1961. Likewise investment in insurance policies and mutual funds also provides tax rebates under the same section. Purchasing power stability or hedge against inflation The investor ensures that the return earned on his investment shall be greater than the inflation rate.

Uday decides to keep aside ` 25,000 every year from the age of 25 until he turned 30, that is, for a period of five years. After 30, he did not touch his investment that is he neither added nor withdrew anything from his capital till he turned 60. Rajesh, on the other hand decided to start saving only when he turned 35. From then on till he turned 65, that is, for the next 30 years, he kept aside ` 25,000 every year. Guess who saved more? At 65, Uday's investment of ` 1.5 lakh was equivalent to ` 54.2 lakh, while Rajesh's savings of ` 7.5 lakh yielded ` 45.23 lakh. Source: Layman's Guide to Retirement Planning. Five steps to help to avoid investment blunders At the beginning of every month chalk out how much you intend to save and invest every month in different assets. Then spread out this amount as per your convenience. Determine your financial goal like child's education, retirement and insurance cover or a house to dwell in. On the basis of your plan invest in a tax saving option. Automate your investment to ensure even if you forget to invest every month, banks can make your payment. In case of insurance do not commit yourself to multi-year payments. Purchase of insurance assessing its features. Buy health insurance after careful considerations of its features and clauses. Be cautious against your deductions. Take into account deductions such as tuition fees of children and home loan repayment while estimating saving needed under section 80c.

His uncle thinks he should invest the saving in safe instruments such as bank deposits. The additional income that Rajiv will earn from his new project provides him good opportunity to build some assets. His prime consideration should be liquidity of his assets depending upon his needs. Another objective that should determine his choice is growth in the value of his assets. Let us critically analyse the various options available to Rajiv for investment. Buying a house would be an attractive option as it would ensure roof and value would appreciate over a period of time. However, the disadvantage erupts when he is transferred to other place or he undertakes some other projects abroad. At a time when his career needs flexibility, the house would be an inflexible investment. Investment in gold too would be limiting his choice since it may turn out to be an illiquid investment. Selling gold may not give a lucrative return and a tough decision considering his wife's passion for jewellery. Bank deposits are no doubt a safe option, but the rate of interest is very low and does not ensure growth over a period of years.

Thus, Rajiv has to take a decision on the basis of the information he collects about various companies. Bonds Bonds are issued to raise funds in the same way an individual borrows funds from banks. An individual has to hypothecate its assets with the bank as security in proportion to the demand for the loan. In case of failure of an individual to refund the money, the bank has the right to sell off these assets to recover its dues. On similar lines, a corporate can borrow funds from the general public. Here the sole borrower is a company and there are many moneylenders in the form of individual investors. Since a company cannot pledge or mortgage its assets separately with each individual, it pledges its assets with a trust constituted for this purpose. The trustee is conferred with the power to dispose of the assets of the company in case of failure to meet the commitment of individual investors. A company issues certificates to bond holders while borrowing funds from the individual investors. This is known as bond certificate. National Saving Certificates National Saving Certificates are bonds issued by the central government with tenure of six years and sold through post offices. Individuals including minors and trusts can invest in NSCs. They are issued in denominations ranging from `. 100 to 10,000. They offer interest rate of 8% compounded half yearly.

Individual investors, like us, may wish to invest directly in shares and the stock market, if we are willing to take risk. However, if we do not have adequate information about the stock market, we may prefer safe investments like fixed deposits in banks. Or, we may decide to invest in mutual funds. As an investor you can do it on your own or seek help of institutional investors . Institutional investors are professionals employed by financial institutions who are responsible for managing money of clients like Rajiv. They advise the client to invest in different kinds of mutual funds and other securities. They select shares and securities of different companies so that investors get a reasonable return on their investment. The employees of financial institutions who make investment decisions for clients are also referred to as portfolio managers. Like institutional investors, individual investors invest a portion of their money to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Individual investors may hold their stock for more than a year. These investors usually analyse the changes in share prices regularly and accordingly take decision to buy or sell different shares. Some stocks may promise a higher return but an individual should keep his capacity for risk bearing intact. An investor should not get swayed by ups and downs in the market. This kind of investor needs to patiently watch the market rather than change decisions on a weekly basis.",

She wondered how he would manage his expenses without his usual salary. Her grandfather then explained since he was working in a government office, he would be getting a sum every month known as pension. Had he worked in a private organisation or engaged in business, he would not be getting pension. In that case he would have to plan or invest money to get a regular flow of income. Sheila suddenly realised that her grandfather still willingly provided her with pocket money. She wondered if there was no pension what would her grandfather have done? Retirement planning is a part of overall financial planning process. It is an attempt to figure out how much money you need to save each month in order to have a comfortable retirement and be financially secure by making best of the accumulated retirement assets. Planning for retirement acquires added importance because, normally, people over-estimate what they have and under-estimate how much they would need for their post- retirement. At the verge of retirement, your needs will rapidly be changing. You will be asking the big questions \u2013 what does retirement mean to me, and will I have enough? How can I be better off? As our lives change, our financial needs and priorities change too. RETIREMENT PLANNING",

The benefit with the person employed with any government organisation is that there is a provision for a pension scheme which serves as a regular income to the retired person to support his/her monthly expenses in the post- retirement years. But, the people outside the pension scheme coverage need to take concrete steps to plan for their post-retirement income and earnings. Thus, in order to be comfortable in the post-retirement years, there is a need to start planning from today itself. The sooner you start investing, the better it is. You can then experience the effect of compounding . Let us take an example: Yogesh, who is now 25 years of age in 2011, starts investing ` 10,000 every month. If his investments grow by 6% p.a., he will end up with ` 1.38 crore in 2046 when he attains the age of 60. If he puts off this exercise for next 10 years, that is, till 2021, he will end up with ` 67.95 lakh. Did you notice that this amount is less than half the amount that he would have if he had began investing early? It is crucial to stay on track, that is, remain committed and disciplined. If you give up the habit of saving and investing midway, it will not yield the expected returns and affect the financial plan for retirement. In order to know how much you need to save, you first need to ascertain how much funds you will need after retirement. This involves calculating your monthly earnings (from occupation, interest, dividends, pension or any other investment that you might have). Here, it is necessary to take into account the rate of inflation . For example, Sunitha would like to retire in 10 years. She expects inflation to be at an average of 6% throughout the period. After retirement she wants to maintain the same level of living standard which she is presently enjoying. At present she is spending ` 10,000 p.m. To calculate how much she should save today will depend how much she would need 10 years from now. With inflation of 6%, the worth of ` 10,000 p.m. today would approximately be ` 17,900 p.m. 1 , i.e., `",

You can choose the age but cannot postpone it indefinitely. The biggest question is, when the time of retirement arrives, will you have enough income to continue the lifestyle you were enjoying before retirement. The amount of pension alone will not be sufficient for most of us. Remember, the average life expectancy is improving with the advancement in the health care sector. The average person who retires at the age of 58-60 looks forward to another 20 years of life. For this it becomes imperative to save enough funds in your 30-35 working life. Inflation is a widespread and sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services. Economists say that when prices go up 3 per cent or more a year, the country is in a state of inflation. While just about everyone gets hurt by inflation, people who live on fixed incomes may feel the crunch more than others because prices rise but their income doesn't. That's why it makes sense to build-in inflation into your retirement plans. 10,000 X1.06 17900 1 10 = 1",

Tools for Planning Financial Independence Financial independence is the goal of retirement planning. It is not something that can be done in a day, a week, or even in a month. It is not an event but rather a recursive and cyclical process. The key aspect of retirement planning is to choose the right investment vehicles which will help you reaching your financial goals. Portfolio planning/Asset allocation A good retirement planning depends on asset allocation rather than confining oneself to a single investment. For this reason, it is good to spread your investment capital around and understand the income and growth objectives for future performance. You should not put all your eggs in the same basket. What is required is a portfolio with right combination of assets. You may have various financial assets, namely, shares, debentures, bonds, life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, fixed deposit, company deposits, PPF, monthly income schemes, national savings certificates, etc., in your portfolio. In addition to this, it may also contain tangible assets that can take the form of gold, silver jewellery, precious stones like diamonds, real estate, painting, carvings, etc., and other collectibles. Apart from providing good hedge against inflation, they also emerge as an attractive alternative investment avenue. You may also have some insurance to cover risk. What assets? Primarily, all assets are divided into two categories: i. Real assets ii. Financial assets Your real assets are the physical assets that you own and are tangible. It means investing in immovable property such as a house, a flat, a plot of land or a commercial space. The other item under real asset is gold and other precious stones. However, investment in gold jewellery is mostly done with the intention of safe keeping rather than for sale-resale purposes. The positive side of investing in gold is its high liquidity value. Financial assets are the claims on real assets and can be converted into cash easily. Depending on the nature of investment, financial assets are of two types: equity and debt. What you can do to achieve your retirement goals The retirement is a new chapter in one's life and the life is not over by any means at the time of retirement.

Diversification and optimal asset allocation in accordance with one's risk appetite is a key to successful financial and retirement planning. 3.

Investment in stocks involves buying shares of public and private companies. When you buy shares of a company, you become a part owner of the company and share the company's profit and bear losses. Shares can be bought from both primary market (public offering) and secondary market (stock exchange). Shares are traded in the stock exchange and their prices fluctuate on daily basis. Investment in share market should be a purely long-term investment. Mutual funds are essentially a pooling of small resources of individuals which are handed over to a professional fund manager who invests this money in the stock exchange and according to the objectives of the scheme. Debt: Bank fixed deposits is one of the very popular investment avenues in India. This investment is commonly done by the people who have a very low risk taking aptitude and wish to make safe investment in banks. Similar to the bank fixed deposits, the postal saving schemes continue to be one of the most popular fixed income instruments in India. The post office small saving schemes like Kisan Vikas Patra , Monthly Income Scheme, Public Provident Fund, Time Deposit Scheme, Recurring Deposit, National Saving Scheme and Senior Citizen Scheme are backed by sovereign guarantee and are zero risk investments. These schemes, however, have a lock-in period between 1-15 years ( refer Figure 2). The services of the post office has been successfully tapped into the rural savings market by offering higher rate of return than that extended by scheduled banks.

Pension Schemes Further, the new pension schemes introduced by the government to give people a way to get a pension during their old age. Employees of the government sector already get a pension, so this scheme is introduced as a security measure that enables people from the unorganised sector to draw a pension as well.

You can then withdraw the money when you retire which is currently at 60 years. NPS is meant to be a pension scheme , so it is geared towards giving you a steady stream of income on your retirement.

Each type of investment has distinct advantages and disadvantages, which tends to behave differently in different types of economic mood and swings. Your retirement portfolio should broadly be diversified and well balanced. Estimating the Retirement Expenses Let us now review various factors that you should consider while building your retirement portfolio. The Power of Compounding For sound financial planning, cash flows should be related to the relevant time period. Distinction has to be made between ` 100 received today and ` 100 to be received at a future date. This is because the ` 100 received today can earn interest on it. Assume the rate of interest at 15% p.a. and consider the following example:",

Hence, 'compounding' implies earning interest on your interest. Here, the point to note is that the more often interest is compounded, the more you accumulate. Thus, semi-annual compounding pays more than annual compounding, quarterly more than semi-annual and monthly more than quarterly. (see table 1. ) 9,083 16,502 9,031 16,310 8,954 16,036 Monthly Quarterly Semi-annual Annual 8,810 15,530 Growth of an investment of ` 5000 invested @12% p.a. Frequency of compounding Amount at the end of 5 years Amount at the end of 10 years The simple way to figure out the impact of compounding is illustrated by the 'rule of 72'. When funds are invested on a compound interest basis, your investment doubles at regular frequencies depending on the rate of interest and frequency of compounding. There is a simple method of calculating how long it will take for your money to double: divide 72 by the interest rate. For example, at 8% it takes 9 years (72/9), it takes approx. 6 years (72/12) and at 24 % it takes 3 years (72/24). This rule applies to compound interest only. The impact of compound interest is solely reaped in the long run. The longer you keep your investments on compound interest basis, the greater is your gain. The best way is to invest in mutual funds or set up a RD account with a bank. The decision regarding choosing between an RD and SIP depend on one's requirement, risk taking aptitude and the time period of investment.

    "text": "70 One of the best options to get a regular income is annuities . Annuities are monthly payments you receive from a financial institution after you invest a lump sum in it. The returns from these investments along with a part of principal form the monthly payment accruing to you. You can buy an annuity plan from a life insurance company or a mutual fund. A regular income can also be generated from a variety of investment instruments such as National Savings Certificates or deep discount bonds that give you a pre- determined lump sum on maturity. If you invest in these at regular intervals your investments will mature at regular intervals in your retirement years creating a regular income flow. For example, Mr. Prakasa Rao who will be retiring in 2016 does not want to utilise his pension money to meet regular (both periodic/recurring) capital expenses like house repairs. He wants to invest some money for such expenses. For him, small saving schemes like NSC's-- six year tenure, 8% interest compounded half yearly is a handy option. If he invests ` 5000 quarterly beginning 2010, this is how his investments will flow to him in 2016, i.e., his first year of retirement: Other avenues which can be tapped for a regular income are post office monthly income schemes (POMIS), senior citizen's savings scheme, bank FD's and bonds and other debt products. Income could also come from dividends, monthly income plans of mutual funds, systematic withdrawal plans (SWP) of mutual fund schemes along with the rent from any property you might own. Creating a Lump Sum Income Besides a regular income, you will also require lump sum amount in your post-retirement years. Your requirements may relate to the higher education of your children, children's marriage or a sudden illness, etc. In this case, the needs are classified as : Future needs: These needs are known and can be listed in terms of the amount required as and when they arise. You have two alternatives: (a) Invest the lump sum ( large amount ) and receive a lump sum on maturity. You may opt for infrastructure bonds with a suitable tenure. Other options available are NSC's and Government of India Savings Bonds (RBI bonds), Kisan Vikas Patra and fixed maturity plans which mutual fund companies launch regularly and (b) invest a fix amount regularly and receive a lump sum on maturity.",

You know that government spends money for providing many public services, like, highways, police, defence, etc., and basic facilities such as schools and hospitals to the poor and underprivileged thus creating an egalitarian society. It is also used for funding developmental programmes and services. Government gets money from taxes and therefore it is vital for all its citizens to pay taxes.

    "text": "74 How taxes affect our economy? Taxes, the main source of revenue are used by the rulers or the government to carry out many functions. No government in the world can run its administrative offices without funds and it has no such system incorporated in itself to generate profit from its functioning. Therefore, it can be well understood that the purpose of taxation is very simple and obvious for proper functioning of a state. The expenditures of the government include providing economic infrastructure (roads, railways, etc.), public services (education systems, health care systems, public transportation, etc.), public utilities (energy, water and waste management, etc.) for the enforcement of law and order, to meet expenditures on defence, and the operation of government itself. The money is also utilized for relief and rehabilitation in case of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. Space programme, missile programme and nuclear programme are also funded from the revenue collected as tax. Taxes, apart from being a source of revenue to government also are used to influence the functioning of the economy (the government's strategy for doing this is called fiscal policy), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy. It influences the economy by affecting resource allocation, consumer behaviour and even the nation's productivity and growth. To reallocate its scarce resources for ensuring welfare, government may tax highly some commodities (say luxuries). It regulates consumption of some commodities (tobacco is taxed, for example, to discourage smoking, and other injurious commodities like alcohol, etc). To ensure long-term growth it may impose taxes on production of consumer goods and give concession for production of capital goods. Apart from interest rates, the deductions allowed in taxes for the savings also inspire people to save. The provision of exemptions of income that have been diverted into various saving schemes results in increased saving in the economy. Taxes also help in redistribution. Normally, this means transferring wealth from the richer sections of society to poorer sections, thereby reducing inequality in the income levels. When government imposes taxes on the richer section and uses it for the welfare of it citizens, it is transferring wealth from few high income groups to low income groups. Taxes also make the government accountable. The government tax citizens, and citizens in turn demand accountability from their government. Tax planning implies minimization of taxes-- pay as little as possible by saving",

Tax planning implies minimization of taxes-- pay as little as possible by saving and investing wisely. The goal is to arrange financial affairs so as to minimize taxes. How can we do this? The key lies in prudent and effective tax planning. It is important to plan for taxes as it affects your personal budget-- your savings, expenditure and consumption so dearly. Tax planning means devising strategies all the year round so as to minimize the liability of tax that one owes to the government. You have to plan sensibly so as to pay less money to the government as tax thereby reducing your tax burden. As a result save more money for yourself. Planning taxes reduces the burden of tax on a person and also helps him to make savings by investing in various saving schemes. India has a well-developed taxation structure. The tax system in India is mainly a three-tier system, comprising the Central government, State Governments and the local government's organizations which include panchayats and municipalities.

    "text": "75 History of taxation: Taxation dates back to earliest recorded history. In the beginning, in all societies, the most common way to collect taxes was in kind. Taxes were paid in the form of gold-coins, cattle, grains, raw materials and even by rendering personal service. As economies became money based, countries started collecting taxes in cash. In addition to the revenues from land, tax on the basis of ownership of immovable properties also became prevalent. Evidence show that all historical leaders and head countrymen collected taxes to run its authority. In India, the tradition of taxation has a long history. Archeological findings indicate a taxation system as old as about 6000 years ago at a place called Lagash. It finds its references in many ancient books like 'Manu Smriti' and 'Arthasastra'. Manu, the sage and lawgiver in Vedic times, stated in his 'Manu Smriti' that the king could levy tax and advised that taxes should be related to the profession, income and expenditure of the person. With the coming on of the Mughals in India, the country witnessed a sea of change in the taxation system of India. Although, they also practised the same norm of taxation but it was more homogeneous in structure and collection. The period of British rule in India witnessed some remarkable change in the taxation system of India. The objectives of taxation were designed to protect and enlarge the economic and strategic interests of the East India Company and the Crown. After the revolt of 1857, the first formal income-tax on traders and professionals became operative in 1860. Setting up of administrative system and taxation system was first done in the history of taxation system in India in 1922. Independent India brought out changes in the nature and objectives of taxation, which became directly linked with national programmes for citizens' welfare. Nowadays taxation is seen as an instrument not only to augment finance of the government but also to fulfill certain social objective, both being interlinked. Taxes are collected from a number of sources. The government raises revenue from a variety of taxes -- taxes on income (like, individual income tax, corporate income tax) taxes on property (like, wealth tax, estate taxes, death duties, property taxes), taxes on commodities (like, sales tax, excise duties, customs duties) and other taxes (like service taxes, entertainment taxes).

Direct taxes are those that are imposed and paid by the tax payer directly to the government (like, taxes on income and wealth) Indirect taxes are those taxes that we pay indirectly to the government (like, taxes on commodities). An understanding of these taxes is necessary for us to be aware of the payments that we have to make. In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes -Benjamin Franklin",

For all financial transactions (be it investing, purchasing, etc.) that you make above a certain limit, it is now mandatory to quote your Permanent Account Number (PAN ). This makes it easier for taxman to trace all your investment/savings. This number is mandatory for filing income tax returns, opening a depository account, buying or selling property, large cash transaction- You need a PAN for many things that affect your life. Income tax When you start earning incomes beyond the exemption limit, you will have to pay taxes which are progressive, meaning that the more you earn, the more you pay. Income tax is levied on the income of individuals or on the profits earned by companies and businesses. Personal income tax and corporate income tax together contribute towards a major share of tax revenue to central government. The Income Tax Act was incorporated in India in1860. Income taxes are imposed by the Government of India on taxable income of Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), companies, individuals, firms, co-operative societies and trusts (which are identified as a body of individuals and association of persons). Even the gifts that you receive from persons other than relatives come under the purview of income tax and are included in your income. Corporate Tax When a company earns profit, corporate tax has to be paid. Corporate tax is the tax charged on the profits earned by associations and companies by several jurisdictions. The excess of earnings that a company makes over the expenses incurred (cost of production) will be your profit. On this profit, the company has to pay corporate tax according to rules. This corporate tax also applies to foreign corporations that have economic bases in India ( e.g, Microsoft, Agro-tech, Hewlett-Packard). It applies to all people working for a corporation, including income for work done in a foreign country and work done for a corporation that is situated in a foreign country. The rate of corporate tax in India depends on whether the profits have been passed on to the shareholders or not. Capital Gains Tax Did you know that you will have to pay taxes on all your capital gains that you receive upon the sale of assets? A capital gain is any income generated by selling a capital investment (business stocks, paintings, houses, family business, farmhouse, etc.).

Wealth Tax The wealth that you possess also entails you to contribute towards the tax exchequer. Wealth tax is levied on the property owned depending on the market value of it. If you possess net wealth over a certain exemption limit (now `. 30 lakh) other than ownership of one residential property it is mandatory to pay wealth tax and file a return to avoid tax collector knocking at your door. Excise Duty You pay taxes to the government while purchasing commodities. One among the indirect tax is the excise duty which is one of the most well known forms of taxation in India. Excise duties are imposed on goods at the time of production. It is paid to the government by the factory itself, but in reality the burden of the tax falls on those who buy the goods. The producer increases the prices of goods they sell to cover the amount that they have paid in form of excise duties. The rates of excise duties vary depending on the nature of commodity. Excise tax also serves various purposes of price control, adequate supply of essential commodities, promotion of small-scale industries and industrial growth.",

They are highly priced because of the foreign exchange rate (the value of Indian rupee compared to the foreign currency) and also it includes the customs duty imposed on them. Government imposes customs duty not just with the intention of earning revenue but also to control the commodities moving out and moving in the country. Customs duties are charged on those commodities which we bring in from other countries (import duties) and which we export to other countries (export duties). Usually, the goods that are imported to the country are charged customs duty along with educational cess. The customs duty is evaluated on the value of the transaction of the goods. The Central Board of Excise and Customs under the Ministry of Finance manages the customs duty process in the country. Types of state taxes Apart from the central taxes, we also pay certain taxes on various goods and services to the state government. Let us see which these taxes are: Sales Tax/VAT Probably this is one of the taxes that you have been paying indirectly to the government. When you purchase commodities or when you eat at a restaurant your bills are inclusive of the sales/VAT taxes. The state governments in India impose sales tax which is paid by the dealer or shopkeeper and this amount is later added to the price of the good. The taxes range in percentages according to the type of goods. Essential commodities such as food, room and board are not taxed. Petroleum, tobacco and liquor are taxed, but the percentage varies from region to region, as the state governments have regulatory control. In most cases, sales taxes are charged on the sale of movable goods. The sales taxes have been replaced with Value Added Tax (VAT). This is the tax that a manufacturer needs to pay while purchasing raw materials and a trader needs to pay while purchasing goods. VAT is eventually expected to replace sales tax. All goods and services provided by business individuals and companies come under the ambit of VAT. The VAT rates of petroleum, tobacco, liquor and so on are higher and differ from state to state.

However, if you are to think of tax planning not just as a tax saving exercise instead as a part of overall investment strategy then you have to smarten up the tax-planning exercise. The tax-saving investment that you choose can eventually play a significant part in achieving your financial goals. How to plan for taxes Arranging transactions helps in optimizing our tax liability. An understanding of the tax process and tax strategies will help to lower your taxes taking full advantage of the tax benefits. For this, the provisions of the Income Tax Act: all accessible allowances, exemptions, deductions, etc., are to be used judiciously. Know the Tax process: Basics of income tax WHO? All residents in India, whose total income level is more than the maximum exemption limit, are under the domain of chargeable income tax.

The return has to be filed by 30 th September of the assessment year if the individual, being a sole proprietor, has his accounts subjected to tax audit or is a partner of a partnership firm whose accounts are subject to tax audit and by 31 st July of the assessment year for any other assessee. HOW? The income tax payments are paid in the sort of tax deducted at source (TDS), tax collected at source (TCS), and advance tax before the last due date of March 31st. WHY? Government earns revenue through taxes so as to provide basic services and certain amenities to its people in the national interest. Exemptions: Income tax Exemptions refer to specified income, which are earned but not taxable. It means that at the time of calculating annual income, this type of income will not come under the purview of tax.

Choice between PPF and NSC depends whether you are saving to provide for a long- term need or you prefer to make lump sum investment and have a shorter investment horizon. In the former situation PPF would be a better option and in case of latter, the option may be NSC with duration of 6 years or fixed deposits with banks for 5 years. These tax saving measures provide assured rates return, however, offer only negative real returns in an inflationary scenario. Deductions are also available on various insurance schemes. But the choice of an insurance scheme should be made without tax saving benefits taking precedence over the insurance aspect. Investment in the insurance schemes should have the best insurance cover and not just tax sops. The tax deductions help to deduct an amount from the taxable income and therefore save tax. Whereas, investment in equities through ELSS scheme will help to beat inflation and have the lowest lock-in period of 3 years. However, after the direct tax code comes into effect ELSS will cease to be a tax saving option. Tax reliefs are also available on investments in long-term infrastructure bonds of specified companies. The interest rates of these bonds are not as high as that offered by the banks on fixed deposits, but still as it is offered as an additional tax shield they turn out to be worth investing.

Increasing income of the middle class, along with a high saving rate requires an understanding of financial matters even at the school stage. In addition, the country has a sound banking system and healthy financial sector.

The study of the subject helps the young to properly manage their money and make optimal decisions for their future. Personal financial literacy includes the ability to read, analyse, manage and communicate about their financial condition that affects their material well being. It helps in making a financial plan for the future, discuss issues relating to finance comfortably and enable them to take informed financial decision throughout their lives.

On examining the nature of work, one finds ample opportunity for learners in the field of personal finance. There is a rising number of self directed investment plans and a growing number of seniors who wish to invest in effective retirement plans. You must have observed whenever you are considering buying an insurance policy or investing in a mutual fund, you try to contact an agent dealing with such financial products. The agent then advises us on various details like premium, number of years of the policy, the risk involved and the amount assured on maturity of the policy. The agents because of their expertise and training given by insurance companies have managed to pursue such a vocation. Similarly mutual fund companies also have trained agents to sell their products. If anyone goes to the income tax office to file their returns, there are large number of people offering to help them fill in all kinds of forms (Form 16 for salaried people). Banks also have agents to assist to fill up PPF forms, fixed deposit forms, loan application forms, etc. These individuals by virtue of their training and experience have the ability to advise others on personal finance issues. Therefore, a course in personal finance can be an option for a lucrative career in this field. Career planning in personal finance Career planning means acquiring a required degree, finding a job in a good company or be self-employed, showing up for work each day and eventually securing a retired life with lump sum payment.

Savings are the surplus of income over expenditu re. a. Income - Money earned from various sources like Salary, Wages, etc. b. Expenditure - Money spent on various items which include essential and non - essential items. People usually meet their short term goals with savings. Money in savings account of a ban k earns a small amount of interest and it is easy to withdraw it whenever needed. People can save in savings bank accounts , Post Office savings accounts, etc. What are Investments? Investment is the act of deployment of money out of savings into financia l or non - financial products with the expectation of earning higher returns over a period of time. The various products in which investments may be done are financial products viz. fixed deposit in bank, buying shares in stock market, investing in Mutual fu nds , etc. and non - financial products viz. purchase of land, gold, silver , etc. The investments may be done for short term, medium term or long - term. While investing one should always remember that return on investments may rise or fall over time and it is quite normal for that to happen. Difference between Savings and Investments is mentioned in the table below: Savings in Bank Accounts Investment in Fixed Deposits and other financial products Meaning A portion of one\u2019s income which is not used for expe nses. P utting your money in various investment products to make money grow. Purpose Savings are made to maintain liquidity to meet short term or urgent requirements.

    "text": "Financial Education Booklet 6 | P a g e What is the importance of saving and investing? Investing money makes it grow for you. A ny increase in the value of the investment over a period of time, or investment income/returns that you receive, gets you that much closer to your financial goals. One should start saving and investing early in his or her life. The earlier you start, the b etter you will be placed in meeting your goals like owning a house, financing your child's education, funding for your retirement, etc. What are Assets and Liabilities? I tems that you own and have economic value are your assets and items which you owe to others or have borrowed from others are your liabilities. For example, if you save and then invest in a fixed deposit, it is your asset. On the other hand, if you borrow funds/ take a loan from a bank or any individual, it is your liability. What is Deb t? Money borrowed to meet shortfall of money when expenses are more than the funds available in hand is called debt. What is the Time Value of Money? As time passes, you will realize that if 10 years back you could afford to purchase a full lunch for a p articular amount of money, then today you could afford to get only a portion of the lunch in that amount of money. This means that the value of a five - hundred - rupee note would be higher today than after five years. Although the note is the same, you can do much more with the money if you ha ve it now because over a period, you can make the money grow by earning interest on the money. By receiving \u20b9 500 / - today, you can increase the future amount of your money by investing the money and gaining interest or capital appreciation over a period of time . At the most basic level, the time value of money shows that time literally is money, i.e. the value of the money you have now is not the same as it will be in the future and vice versa. What is Inflation and its effect on Investments? Inflation refers to rise in prices of goods and services. Over a period of time , as the cost of goods and services incre ases, the ability",

Over a period of time , as the cost of goods and services incre ases, the ability of a unit of money, say one rupee, to buy goods and services keeps declining. In other words, the Purchasing Power of money, i.e. ability of money to buy anything, decreases. It is important to take into account the effects of inflation o n your investments during financial planning. Investors greatly fear inflation since it reduces the value of their investment. How does inflation affect my investment decision? A Vada Pav costing \u20b9 2/ - five years ago would now cost \u20b9 7/ - . Th is increase in t he price is not as a result of higher quantity or a better quality of the Vada Pav, but due to inflation impacting the prices of the ingredients and finally the end product.",

T ry to determ ine your \"real rate of return\u201d, or the return you can expect after factoring in the effects of inflation. To reduce the risk of decrease in the value of money, you can invest the money available to you today at a rate equal or higher than the r ate of inflation. What is Power of Compounding? With simple interest, you can earn interest only on the principal (that is, the amount you initially invested); while with compounding interest, you earn interest on the principal as well as, previously earn ed interest. Let us understand the magic of compounding with the help of an example. Year Principal Rate of return Return earned Maturity value 1 1 ,000 9% 90 1,090 2 1 ,090 (1000+ interest earned of 90) 9% 98 1,188 3 1,188 (1,000+interest earned 90+9 8) 9% 295 1295 10 2,172 9% 195 2,367 * 20 5,142 9% 463 5,604 40 28,816 9% 2,593 31,409 *Principal amount is changing at the end of every year on account of addition of return earned for that year to the principal. As principal is increasing every year , the return earned on increased principal also is increasing. The above example shows how an initial investment of \u20b9 1,000 / - grows to \u20b9 31,409 / - over a period of 40 years. When the return is reinvested, you earn a return on the previously earned return and so on. Whereas in case of simple interest, the principle amount remains at \u20b9 1 , 000 / - only for all the 40 years and w ith annual interest of \u20b9 90 / - , the amount grows to only \u20b9 4 , 600 / - . Note: - Principal + return from the first year collectively becomes the principal for the second year. - Principal + return from the second year collectively becomes the Principal for the third year and so on .",

    "text": "Financial Education Booklet 8 | P a g e The Rule of 72 Mathematicians say that you can find out how long it will take you to double your money simply by dividing the number 72 by the interest rate. So let's say your parents give you \u20b9 200 / - for your birthday and you plan t o invest it. If you put the money into an account that earns 6 percent (6%) interest a year, how long will it take to grow to \u20b9 400 / - / ? 72 / 6% interest = 12 years So in 12 years, your money will have doubled to \u20b9 400 / - . Rupee Cost Averaging Rupee cost av eraging is the process in which you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals irrespective of market fluctuations. For example, you buy more units when unit prices are low and less units when unit prices are high. By investing according to a sche dule, you avoid the complex or even impossible duty of trying to figure out the exact best time to invest. The rupee cost averaging effect averages out the costs of your units and hence lessens the impact of short - term market fluctuations on your investmen ts. For example, look at the table below: Month Amount Paid Cost per unit Number of units bought (Amount paid / Cost) Jan 2000 50.00 40 Feb 2000 41.67 48 Mar 2000 47.62 42 Apr 2000 58.82 34 May 2000 71.42 28 Jun 2000 66.67 30 Divide the rule number (72) by the annual interest rate (R) to find out the approximate time (T) required for doubling your money.",

These goals change over an individual's lifetime and accordingly the financial plan should b e reviewed on a regular basis for any modification as per change in the circumstances. TIP : While making financial plans, one should first ensure a planned savings amount and then plan for meeting expenses. Mr. Warren Buffett, one of world\u2019s successful i nvestor, has said: - \u201c Don\u2019t save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving. \u201d Therefore, the basic concept that everyone should focus upon while utilising his income is as follows: Income \u2013 Savings = Expenditure Wealth is not built ove rnight.

By saving regularly, I will become a millionaire. By saving regularly, I will be debt free by January next year. If I continue saving regularly after clearing all my debt, by next December I will be saving the sufficient amount to fund six months of my living expenses.

I will save \u20b9 50,000/ - every year for next 10 years for my daughter's marriage. Goal - based investing focuses on meeting goals that are personal and specific. The focus of this approach is to arrive at future va lue of different goals and then pursuing these goals through asset allocation made for investments according to each individual\u2019s financial goal. To adopt this strategy while investing, one must plan as per one's age, risk appetite (ability to take risk), financial situation and investment horizon. Five - Step Approach to Achieve Financial Goals STEP 1: Identify specific financial goals It is important to prepare a proper plan to fix each investment with a specific goal. It is very important to identify one \u2019s financial goals and aspirations and estimate the amount of money it would be needed to fulfil them. STEP 2: Classify goals into Short - term, Medium term or Long term \u2022 Short - term goals are typically financial requirements that are expected to arise in tim e period ranging from a few months to one year. \u2022 Medium - term goals may have a time horizon of one year to eight years. Goals like buying a property, starting your own venture, getting enrolled in a professional course, etc. can be medium - term financial goa ls. \u2022 Long - term goals may have a time horizon of eight years or more for example child's marriage, retirement planning, etc.",

Asset Classes may be referred to groups of financial instruments which have similar financial characteristics. Asset Allocation refers to an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward - in the form of returns - by dividing the assets of an individual\u2019s portfolio according to his/her financial goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. Asset Allocation A llocate a ssets depending on your age, lifestyle, family commitments an d your financial goals. While allocating your funds, distribute your investments across various asset classes such as equity, bonds, real estate, etc., to benefit from diversification , which helps reduce risk and increases the possibility of earning modera te to high returns on your investments. For example: An individual\u2019s portfolio when he/she invest s in various asset classes (depending upon his financial goals, risk appetite, investment horizon, etc.) may look like any of the following: STEP 4: Choose the right investments with diversification (within asset classes) Arriving at the right risk - return combination and choosing the right asset allocation can seem difficult. For a longer term goal, it is advisable to focus on maximizing returns with d iversified asset allocation. Diversification It refers to the process which reduces risk by making investments into various financial instruments, industries and other categories. It aims to minimize loss on return by investing in different asset classes (debt, equity, gold, real assets , etc.) t hat would react differently to the same event, such as those relating to the economy or markets. Although diversification does not provide guarantee against loss, it is the most important component for reaching lon g - term financial goals while minimizing risk.

STEP 5: Review and revise financial plans To stay on track, regularly review the progress towards your goals and investments. Review your investments like stocks and mutual funds in your portfolio. Certain products may seem tailor - mad e for specific needs, but they may not be actually useful for one's portfolio. Be aware of such investment options. C. Choosing Investment Options & Understanding Risk The investment products available for an investor are fixed income securities, equity inve stments, mutual funds, etc. Every asset class has its own risk and return. Investments in equities are considered as high risk investments as their returns are subject to performance of individual companies and general economic scenario. On the other hand, investments in the debt instruments are considered having relatively low risk. For instance, Government bonds are considered to be effectively \"risk free\" due to the trust that government will not default on the repayment to investors. Three pillars of investment - The investment decision by an individual is influenced by safety, liquidity and return. They are called the three pillars of investment. i. Safety : This is about how well protected the principal and return on the investment is. For instance, i f you lend \u20b9100/ - to someone, will it be repaid on time? Or, is your capital of \u20b9100/ - safe? Safety means your money invested is protected and there is every possibility that on the agreed date, or maybe even before, it would be returned whenever needed. ii. Liquidity : This pillar of investment is the degree of ease with which you can en - cash or liquidate your investment at fair value. In the above example, it will be about how soon will you get your money back if you need it immediately? iii. Return : What is the return you will get on your investments? It could be in the form of income, appreciation of capital invested or both. Income means an investment's earnings in the form of interest or dividend payment.

In case the market value is lower than the value at the time of investment, it is called depreciation or loss. D. Returns from Investment Returns from Investment can be described as money made by an investor on his/ her investment. The returns can be in two ways as explained below: Regular Income \u2022 Equity Investment : You get dividend when you b uy and hold equity shares of a company and units of equity mutual fund. \u2022 Fixed Income Investment : In debt securities, you receive fixed interest on interest bearing Investments Capital Appreciation \u2022 When the value of initial investment increases over a per iod of time and the investor benefits by selling part or whole of the investment at the increased value , it is called Capital Appreciation. Example of Capital Appreciation : An investor bought 100 shares of company XYZ Ltd . at \u20b9 50/ - per share by paying \u20b9 5,000/ - in total. When the value of XYZ share increases to \u20b9 65/ - per share, and the investor sells 100 shares in the market, he or she will get 6,500 (100 Shares at \u20b9 65/ - per share). The investor stands to gain \u20b9 1500/ - from the i nitial investment that he has made. This is called capital appreciation/capital gain. E. What are Risks and Returns? Risk can be defined as the probability or likelihood of a loss occurring in relation to your expected returns from any particular investment. It is a measure of the level of uncertainty of achieving the returns as per investor expectations. Risk V/S Return Risk and investing go hand in hand.

These include deposit schemes offered by banks, government d eposit schemes, public deposits issued by companies, etc. A. Why to keep money in banks? Drawbacks of keeping cash at home are mentioned as below: \u2022 Unsafe \u2013 Money can be stolen or lost due to natural calamities \u2022 Loss of growth opportunities - Loss of interest income \u2022 No/Low credit eligibility - Deposit in banks creates eligibility for taking loans Therefore, it is beneficial to keep money in banks rather than at home in cash. B. Banking Commercial banks are regulated financial institutions as they deal with pub lic money and trust. Commercial banks in India are regulated by Reserve Bank of India. Banks are required to go through mandatory inspection and audits at various intervals and are also audited by the Reserve Bank of India every year. Bank deposits are c omparatively lower risk investments. Banks offer various types of deposits, depending on the needs of the customers. Bank deposits are preferred more for their liquidity and safety than for the returns. It is also possible to get loans from banks against f ixed deposits up to 75 to 90 % of the deposit amount. Central Government deposit insurance scheme ensures that all deposits are insured by the Government up to a limit of \u20b9 5 lakh s per customer in that particular bank . So, even in case of a failure of a bank, depositors are assured that the Government will step in and return up to \u20b9 5 lakh s of their savings in that bank. For complete details on the scheme, one can refer the w ebsite of Reserve Bank of India, from time to time. C. Account Opening Process \u2014 Know Your Client (KYC) Norms For opening any type of bank account, customers need to undergo the process of complying with KYC norms. KYC Stands for \"Know Your Customer\". The o bjective of KYC is to enable banks to know and understand their customers better and help them manage their risks prudently. The KYC documents generally accepted by banks are: Photograph, Document for proof of identity (copy of PAN Card, Aadhaar Card, etc. ) and Document for proof of address (copy of electricity bill,",

Credit card gives the card holder the benefit of availing credit facility for a certain period of time for example making payments without having immediate money in hand in the form of credit car d transactions. Debit card, on the other hand, is a card issued to a bank account holder for withdrawing money at ATMs from his account as well as to make payment at point of sale. All the merchant establishments accept debit cards in settlement of transa ctions. Both credit and debit cards can be used for withdrawal of cash from ATMs as well as for digital transactions.

H. Customer Liability for unauthorized banking transactions RBI has specified that a customer has no liability when an unauthorized transaction happens on account of fraud, contributory negligence or deficiency on part of the bank. Similarly, even when ne ither the customer nor the bank is at fault, but the problem lies elsewhere in the system, the customer does not have any liability, provided he/ she notifies the bank about the unauthorized or illegal operation within three days of receiving an alert from the bank. And the bank shall credit the amount involved in such transaction to the customer's account within a specified time period. However, in cases where such fraud takes place on account of the negligence of the customer, the entire loss, until the da te of reporting the unlawful transaction, will be borne by the customer. RBI has emphasized banks that they need to send SMS and e - mail alerts to the customers immediately after a transaction is carried out in their account. They have been instructed to e nsure that such messages are enabled to carry the customer's reply too, so that a customer can report any such fraud immediately. I. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of India, was established on April 1, 1935, under t he Reserve Bank of India Act. The Reserve Bank of India uses monetary policy to create financial stability in India, and it is charged with regulating the country's currency and credit systems. The main purpose of RBI is to conduct consolidated supervision of the financial sector in India, which is made up of commercial banks, financial institutions and nonbanking finance companies. It formulates, implements and monitors India's monetary policy.

Be aware of your capacity to handle risk and inves t accordingly. Generally, you can evaluate a potential investment by analysing seven key risks as mentioned below: Types of Risks i.

Commodity price risk is the price uncertainty that adversely impacts the financial position of those who both use and produce commodities. For example, as the price of steel rises, this increases the cost of automobile production and can negatively i mpact that producer's profit margins. Similarly, commodity price risk can equally impact producers of a commodity, not just users. If crop prices are low one year, a farmer may plant less of that crop. If prices subsequently rise next year, the farmer will miss out on a potentially profitable crop. This is called commodity price risk. The factors that can affect commodity prices include political and regulatory changes, seasonal variations, weather, technology and market conditions. Ris k Faced by Various S takeholders Various stakeholders face many risks in commodity trading, especially farmers, such as: \uf0fc Price volatility and price risk \uf0fc Lack of quality storage facilities \uf0fc Need for finance at the time of sowing of crops \uf0fc Dependence on local middlemen and agents for selling their crops \uf0fc Small farm holdings \u2014 no bargaining power \uf0fc Opaque/manipulated prices at Mandis How to protect against price risk in commodities? A producer of a commodity is at risk of prices moving lower. Conversely, a consumer of a commodity is a t risk of prices moving higher. The producers and consumers of commodities can participate in the commodity derivatives exchange to protect against adverse price movements. The process of protecting against financial loss or price risk is called \"Hedging'' . A hedge will guarantee a consumer the supply of a required commodity at a set price and a producer the known price for commodity output.

Commodity Derivative Exchanges A commodity derivative exchange is an organized, regulated market that facilitates the purchase and sale of contracts whose values are linked to the pric e of commodities (e.g., wheat, barley, crude oil, gold, etc.). Typically, the buyers of these contracts agree to accept delivery of a commodity at a price on a future date, and similarly, the sellers agree to deliver the commodity at a price on a future d ate. For example, in case of Agricultur al commodities, Commodity Derivatives Exchange helps in reducing the price risk , both for the farmers (seller of crop) and the consumer (buyers of crop /food processors) by helping them decide a price today (i.e. at the time of sowing or at the time of harvesting of the crop) for the crop to be delivered in the future. The transaction in the exchange is done through commodity brokers. The settlement of contract to buy and sell is guaranteed by the commodity derivative s exchange. The trading rules and procedures of recognized Commodity Derivatives Exchange s and Commodity Brokers are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) \u2014 a statutory body established under SEBI Act, 1992. In India, major commodity derivative exchanges are as follows: \uf0fc Multi C ommodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX) \u2014 predominantly non - agricultural products like gold, silver, aluminium , copper, nickel, lead, zinc and energy products like crude oil and natural gas are traded on this excha nge. \uf0fc National Com modity and Derivative Exchange (NCDEX) \u2014 predominantly agricultural products like pulses, cereals, sugar, etc. are traded on this exchange. There are three types of contracts in commodity derivatives market. These are Forward Contracts, Futures Contract and Options .

This is called hedging the risk. \"A\" hedges the risk by securing the price and \"B\" transacts by pre - booking the price expecting t hat prices would go up in the near future which would benefit him. The payment and delivery of the asset is made on the future date termed as the delivery date. The buyer in the futures contract is known to hold a long position. The seller in the futures c ontracts is said to be having short position. An options contract refers to the financial instrument which gives the buyer of the option the right but not the obligation to exercise the option at a predetermined date at a predetermined price. Options cont racts are of two types as explained below: \uf0b7 Call Option : Call option gives one the right to buy the underlying security \uf0b7 Put Option : Put option gives one the right to sell the underlying security Investors are charged a premium when they buy an options contract. On expiry of the contract, generally the transaction is cash settled instead of actually buying/selling the underlying security unlike in the cash market. Hence, many investors find Futures & Options (F&O) cheaper to trade, h owever, it is riskier than the cash segment because F&O is time dependent and you cannot hold on to the contract till the desired time i.e. when the market is favourable to earn positive returns. On the expiry of the contract, even if you cash settle the c ontract instead of taking delivery, the change in value of the underlying will be either credited or debited to your account.

It is not mandatory but advisable; nomination alleviates the problems face d by legal heirs in case of death of account holder. One should always remember to fill in the nomination details while opening any account. For example, Suresh invests in an FD and nominates his friend, Ramesh as his nominee of his bank FD.

    "text": "Financial Education Booklet 55 | P a g e Chapter 11 - Caution against Ponzi Schemes and Unregistered Investment Advisers Ponzi Schemes Ponzi Schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who constructed one such scheme at the beginning of the 20th century. Of course the concept was well known prior to Ponzi \u2019 s rise to infamy. A Ponzi scheme is a f raudulent investment scheme promising high rates o f return to investors. The scheme generates returns for earlier investors from their own money or money paid by subsequent investors, rather than any actual profit earned. The perpetuation of the returns th at a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an ever - increasing flow of money from investors to keep the scheme going. The Ponzi scheme usually attract new investors by offering returns that other investments cannot guarantee, in the form of short - term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent. As more investors become involved, the likelihood of the scheme coming to the attention of authorities increases. It has been the typical experience that promoter then vanishes, taking all t he remaining investors' money. Such schemes typically collapse under their own weight as fresh investments slow down and the promoter starts having problems paying the promised returns. The system is destined to collapse because the earnings, if any, are less than the payments to investors. Sometimes, the authorities are able to clamp down on such schemes before they collapse because they act on suspicion of a scheme being a Ponzi scheme. How to spot one? Here are few tips that help you to spot a Ponzi sc heme : High returns with little or no risk Every investment carries some degree of risk. Higher the return, higher is the risk involved. Be highly suspicious of any guaranteed high return investment opportunity. Overly consistent returns Investments tend to go up and down over time. Be sceptical about an investment that regularly gives positive returns regardless of overall market conditions. Unregistered investments Ponzi schemes typically involve investment schemes that are not registered with the regul ators or any government agency for their activity. Registration is important because it provides investors with access to information about the company's management, products, services and finances.",

Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms. Non - transparent disclosure Avoid investments if you don't understand them or can't get complete information about them. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as promised. D ifficulty in receiving payments Be suspicious if you don't receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying invested. Protection from fraud Recently, in India, many of the investors lost money because of the operation of unre gistered entities offering investment schemes. The Sharada Chit Fund Scam in West Bengal and the illegal mobilization of funds by Sahara firms are relevant examples. One needs to caution himself or herself about the operation of fraudulent agencies luring investors by offering higher ret urns within a short period .

This is a 2-hour conversation and I think this is one of the most thought-provoking and stimulating conversations I\u2019ve heard in a while. The topics discussed are quite scattered and covers a diverse set of topics, but it has a great flow to it with one thing leading to another. I\u2019m awestruck with Naval\u2019s multi-disciplinary approach to many things in life including inner peace, creativity, capitalism, and of course, wealth creation. The granular clarity he has on these topics is quite impressive. I\u2019d suggest you check out the podcast/YouTube video if you\u2019ve not already done that yet. For obvious reasons, the wealth creation bit lingered on in my mind for a while. I was thinking about what Naval said in this podcast and it resonated with everything I have ever learned and experienced with money and my own pursuit to generate wealth. I\u2019m nowhere close to the \u2018financial freedom\u2019 state he describes in the podcast, but at least I know that I\u2019m not deviating much from the track. While I continue this journey, I thought why not share some of my experiences and learning with you all. Hence this topic on \u2018Personal Finance\u2019. When you think about personal finance, it o\u0000en circles around planning your financials today, so that you have a better tomorrow. While some can do this",

However, I\u2019m not a big fan of approaching a financial advisor to help you chart a plan for yourself and your family. You should be able to do this yourself and your family. A\u0000er all, you know your family and their requirements best. You know what is good for the family and what is not. You work hard for your family today and dream of a secure future for them. Your \u2018Financial Advisor\u2019, won\u2019t do any of this. He is most likely eager to peddle you a financial product that will earn him a good return. He will do the same with you and 20 other clients he may have. So eventually, the onus is on you to secure your family\u2019s and your own financial wellbeing. Remember, this is called \u2018Personal\u2019 finance for a reason. Its best kept personal and dealt with care and diligence. Good news is, this is not rocket science. If you have the skills to do basic arithmetic, then half the battle is won. The rest of the work is just the application part where you\u2019ll figure what is good and what is not.

I finally landed up with a \u2018job\u2019 to do. This was my first job and it was special. A\u0000er working for a month, I got my first pay cheque ever and I was ecstatic. I felt responsible for the first time in my life. I had a bunch of things planned with my first pay. Right from buying my mother a saree to taking my girlfriend (now my wife) out for dinner J. Being in a position to do things for your loved ones always feels good. A\u0000er all the expenses, I still had some money le\u0000 in the account, albeit very little. A good friend of mine suggested that I should invest that money. I brushed away his advise, thinking that the money le\u0000 in my account was very little and would not make any difference whatsoever.

No points of guessing, this continued for years and I never saved a dime. Even today, I regret doing this. In fact, this probably is one of the top regrets in my life. I wish I had started saving early on in life. I\u2019m sure most of your reading this may relate to my story. We all brush aside saving money today because the \u2018amount\u2019 of money we intend to save is very small. We all keep waiting to receive a sizable amount of money so that we can start our savings journey with that. This never happens and unfortunately, we never start saving in life. Here is an advise \u2013 even if it is a small amount, save it. This will make a huge difference in your financial life. Allow me to tell you the story of 3 sisters to help you understand why you need to start saving early in life. A father had triplet daughters. On their 20 th birthday, the father declared that he would pay each daughter a sum of Rs.50,000/- on their birthday, till they were 65 years old. They were free to use this money in whichever way they wanted. As a good father, he also suggested to his daughters that they could invest this money in a promissory note, which would pay them a return of 12% compounded year on year, with a condition that once invested, they were prohibited to withdraw that money till they turn 65. Although they were triplets, their attitude towards money and savings were very different. Here is how each daughter utilized this money \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 4",

She invested the first nine 50Ks that she received in the promissory note, and then the remaining 50K that she received (from 28th birthday to her 65th birthday) were all spent on frivolous things. The second daughter initially spent all the money she received. However, on her 28 th birthday, she got a little serious. She decided to save the same amount as her other sister. So she saved 50K from her 28 th birthday till her 36 th birthday, and the money she received from 37 th to 65 th was spent. The 3 rd sister was a bit casual till her 28 th birthday. She spent all the money she received from her dad. However, on her 28 th birthday, she got a little serious and decided to invest the 50k cash all the way up to 65 years.

Remember, once the money gets invested the promissory note, it gets locked till the 65th birthday and do not forget the promissory note gives a 12% compounded return year on year.

Here we equate the future value of our savings to the amount of money saved today. But there are two other variables at play here \u2013 time and return, both of these when concocted together, works in a beautiful nonlinear way. So, here are how the numbers stack up for the 3 sister problem, the numbers may put you off guard so hold your breath \u2013 The 3 rd sister saves 19L, which grows to a massive 3.05Crs by the time she turns 65 The 2 nd sister saves 4.5L, which grows to an impressive 1.98Crs by the time she turns 65 The 1 st sister saves 4.5L, however, she ends up with a whopping 4.89Crs by the time she turns 65!

The first sister gave full 45 years for the investment to grow, but the 2 nd sister gave only 38 years. See the difference it makes? This is the reason why I regret not starting to save early on in my life The 3 rd sister ends up with the 2 nd highest corpus, but for to that happen she had to save for a very long time. But please note, this still does not match up to the 1 st sister\u2019s corpus. So if you are someone like me, who missed savings during my early days, then the best option we have now is to save for a really long time. I hope by now, I\u2019ve convinced you why you need to start saving early. By starting early, you use time to your advantage and it does play a major role. Wait for a second \u2013 how did I calculate the growth of money for each sister? How did I figure sister 1 saved 4.89Cr and sister 2 saved 1.98Cr? Well, this is calculated by applying the core concept of \u2018Time value of money\u2019. Time value of money is the central theme of personal finance. Hence, for this reason, we need to understand this concept right at the beginning. So in the next chapter, we will discuss time value and its application in more detail.

I know we don\u2019t usually ask a friend to pay us interest, but let\u2019s just assume he is a friend whom you\u2019d like to help, but not at the opportunity cost of your money. The transaction details are below \u2013 Amount \u2013 Rs.100,000/- Tenure \u2013 5 years Interest (%) \u2013 10 As you can see, your friend agrees to repay Rs.100,000/- over a 5 year period and also agrees to pay you an interest of 10%. Given this, how much money will you make at the end of 5 years? Let\u2019s do the math and find out the details. Remember, the yearly interest is paid on the principal amount. Principal = Rs.100,000/- Interest = 10% Yearly interest amount = 10% * 100,000 = Rs.10,000/- Here is how the math looks \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 11 Year Principal Outstanding Interest payable",

The amount you earn from the interest can also be calculated by applying a simple formula, which you may remember from your school days \u2013 Amount = Principal * Time * Return Where the return is the interest percentage. Amount = Rs.100,000 * 5 * 10% = Rs.50,000/- I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that this is quite straightforward and most of you would remember that this is simple interest. In simple interest, the interest gets charged only on the outstanding principal. Imagine a bank transaction, you deposit Rs.100,000/- in a bank\u2019s Fixed Deposit scheme, which promises to pay you a simple interest of 10% year on year for 5 years. At the end of 5 years, you\u2019ll earn Rs.50,000/- as interest income.

    "text": "16 The concept of compounded return is similar to compound interest. The concept of return and interest is very similar, just like the two sides of the same coin. The interest is what you pay when you borrow money in any form and the return is what you earn when you invest your money in any asset. Therefore, if you understand interest, then it is easy to understand the return. In this section, you will learn about how the return is measured. Based on the time horizon of your investment, the return measurement differs. You will use the absolute method to measure the return if your investment horizon is less than a year. Otherwise, if your investment horizon is more than a year, you will use CAGR or the compounded annual growth rate , to measure returns. I guess the difference in absolute and CAGR is best understood with an example. Assume you invested Rs.100,000/- on 1 st Jan 2019 in a financial instrument which yields you a 10% return (per year) and you withdraw this investment a year later. How much money do you make? Quite straight forward as you can imagine \u2013 You will make 10% of 100,000 which is Rs.10,000/-, in other words, your investment has grown by 10% on a year on year basis. This is the absolute return. This is straightforward because the time under consideration is 1 year or 365 days. Now, what if the same investment was held for 3 years instead of 1 year, and what if instead of a simple return of 10%, the return was compounded annually at 10%? How much money would you make at the end of 3 years? zerodha.com/varsity 16",

Applying this formula \u2013 100,000*(1+10%)^(3) = Rs.133,100/- Referring to the previous section, if you were to charge compound interest, then this is the same amount of interest you receive from your friend in the 3 rd year. Continuing on the same lines, here is another question \u2013 If you invest Rs.100,000/- and receive Rs.133,100/- a\u0000er 3 years, then what is the growth rate of your investment? To answer this question, we just need to reorganize this formula \u2013 Amount = Principal*(1+return)^(time) and solve for \u2018 return\u2019. By doing so, the formula reworks itself to \u2013 Return = [(Amount/Principal)^(1/time)] \u2013 1 Return here is the growth rate or the CAGR.

I guess he could not describe it any better. To understand why you need to understand the compound interest in conjunction with time. Compounding in the finance world refers to the ability of money to grow, given that the gains of year 1 get reinvested for year 2, gains of year 2 gets reinvested for year 3, so on and so forth. For example, consider you invest Rs.100 which is expected to grow at 20% year on year (recall this is also called the CAGR or simply the growth rate). At the end of the first year, the money grows to Rs.120. At the end of year 1, you have two options \u2013 Let Rs.20 in profits remain invested along with the original principal of Rs.100 or Withdraw the profits of Rs.20 You decide not to withdraw Rs.20 profit; instead, you decide to reinvest the money for the 2 nd year. At the end of the 2 nd year, Rs.120 grows at 20% to Rs.144. At the end of 3 rd year, Rs.144 grows at 20% to Rs.173. So on and so forth. Compare this with withdrawing Rs.20 profits every year. Had you opted to withdraw Rs.20 every year than at the end of the 3 rd year the profits collected would be Rs. 60. However, since you decided to stay invested, the profits at the end of 3 years are Rs.173/-. This is good Rs.13 or 21.7% over Rs.60 earnt because you opted to do nothing and decided to stay invested. zerodha.com/varsity 18",

The rationale being, that there is no real need for money today, so if you were to take the money today, you\u2019d spend that money on unnecessary things and waste the money. Hence you are better off taking that money two years later. Assuming the above were to be true, here are few questions to you \u2013 1. Does it make sense to equate money across timelines i.e money today versus money tomorrow? 2. How do you move money across a timeline to ensure we compare the right value of money?

For example, if I were to buy a piece of land today then I would expect it to grow to a certain value in 15 years. The amount of money I will receive when I sell this piece of land in 15 years will have a very different value when compared to the same value today. The concept of Present value helps you understand the value of the funds you are likely to receive in the future in today\u2019s terms. Sounds confusing? Probably :) Let\u2019s understand this with an example. Consider that you purchased a piece of land for Rs.15,000,000/- today and held it for 15 years. After 15 years, you sell the land at Rs.75,000,000/-. On the face of it, this looks great, after all, you\u2019ve made a five times return on this. But here is an important question you need to ask yourself. How valuable is Rs.75,000,000/- that you will receive 15 years from now, in today\u2019s terms?

Given the risk-free opportunity cost, what is the amount that needs to be invested today, such that it grows to Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years. The answer to the 2 nd question is, in fact, today\u2019s equivalent of Rs.75,000,000/- that you\u2019d receive in 15 years. So let us figure this out. We are talking about a 15-year time horizon here. The opportunity cost is the equivalent of what else can be done with the funds available if we choose not to invest this money in the real estate deal. The opportunity cost can be found out by figuring out the risk-free rate in the economy and adding a risk premium over and above the risk-free rate. So the opportunity cost \u2013 Opportunity cost = Risk free rate + Risk premium The risk-free rate is the rate at which our money can grow without any risk. Of course, we can endlessly argue that there is nothing like a true risk-free rate, but for the sake of this discussion, let\u2019s assume that the risk-free rate is the Government\u2019s 15-year bond. Usually, the Governments are expected not to default on their payments/repayments, hence the Government or the Sovereign bond is a good proxy for the risk-free rate.

Again for simplicity, let us keep the bid-ask yield aside, we will anyway discuss these things in more detail when we deal with bonds. For now, you need to understand that the risk-free rate for the next 15 years is 7.5%. To figure out the opportunity cost, we can add a risk premium of 1.5-2% more. The risk premium really depends on many things, keeping it simple for now. So, the opportunity cost would be \u2013 7.5% + 1.5% = 9%. Now that we have our opportunity cost sorted, we now need to answer the 2 nd question i.e to figure the amount that we need to invest today at 9%, such that it will grow to Rs.75,000,000/- at the end of 15 years. A trial and error method can figure this amount. Alternatively, we can use the concept of \u2018 discounting \u2019, wherein we discount Rs.75,000,000/- at 9%, which will give us the same answer.

The present value forumla is \u2013 Present value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) We know, Future value = Rs.75,000,000/- Discount rate = 9% Time = 15% We can plug these numbers in the equation \u2013 = 75,000,000 / (1+9%)^(15) = 20,590,353 This means, the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- is Rs.20,590,353/-. In other words, Rs.75,000,000/- in today\u2019s terms is the same as Rs. 20,590,353/- in 15 years. Given this, if someone makes an offer to buy the property at Rs.20,590,353/- today, then it is as good as receiving Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years, because if Rs.20,590,353/- invested at the opportunity cost of 9%, will yield Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years.

    "text": "27 The future value of money is simply the inverse of the present value of money. Going by the real estate example, the future value of money helps us find an answer to a question like this \u2013 What will be the value of Rs.20,590,353/- in 15 years from now? To find an answer to this question, we again must find out the opportunity cost. Irrespective of future value or present value problems we are trying to solve, the opportunity cost remains the same. So, 9% will be the opportunity cost. To find the future value of money, we must compound the amount at the given rate of opportunity cost. Recall from the previous chapter, the compounding formula \u2013 = P*(1+R)^(n), which is also the future value, therefor \u2013 Future value = P*(1+R)^(n) Where, P = Amount R = opportunity cost N = Time period Applying this, = 20,590,353 * (1+9%)^(15) Now, before I post the answer to the above question, what does your intuition say the answer is? Remember, when we worked out the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- at a 9% discount rate for 15 years, the answer was 20,590,353. Now, we zerodha.com/varsity 27",

    "text": "28 are trying to do the exact opposite i.e compound 20,590,353 at 9% for 15 years. So the answer has to be 75,000,000. When you do this math \u2013 = 20,590,353 * (1+9%)^(15) = 75,000,000 This is the future value of money. So in simple terms, if you had an option to receive 75,000,000 after 15 years or 20,590,353 today, then essentially both of these are the same deal. 3.4 \u2013 The offer We started this chapter with a hypothetical situation. Your generous friend gives you two options \u2013 Option A \u2013 He gives you Rs.10,000/- right away Option B \u2013 He promises to give your Rs.10,000/- exactly two year from now Chances are that you selected option B. However, can we tackle this situation better? Now that we know the concept of the time value of money aka the present and future value of money? Of course, we can. The problem here is that we are trying to compare the value of Rs.10,000/- today versus Rs.10,000/- two years from now. Now, if we were to opt for option A, we will have an option to invest this money in an interest-bearing instrument and grow this money. As of today, a two year fixed deposit will yield anywhere close to 7.5%. Given this, we now have to find out the future value of Rs.10,000/- at 7.5% opportunity rate (or the compounding rate). zerodha.com/varsity 28",

    "text": "29 = 10000*(1+7.5%)^(2) = Rs.11,556.25/- This also means, that if we were to accept option B, we would be essentially accepting a value much lesser than Rs.10,000/-. A fair deal here would be either Rs.10,000/- today or Rs.11,556.25/- two years from now! This also leads us to one of the most important conclusions in finance \u2013 Money today is far valuable than money tomorrow because today we have an option to invest this money and grow it at a risk-free rate. 3.5 \u2013 Real-life applications So before we wrap up this chapter, let us consider a few real-life (like) situations and apply the concept of Future Value (FV) and Present Value (PV) of money. These are just made-up situations, you will appreciate the application of FV and PV better later in this module when the example will be probably more tangible. Question \u2013 So assume you are saving for your daughter\u2019s education at a foreign university. She is ten years today, and she is expected to go to the US when she is 25 years old, which is 15 years away. The tuition fees including the cost of living are expected to be roughly Rs.6,500,000/-. Given this, how much should you have today? Answer \u2013 When you have a situation like this, the first thing to do is to figure out if this is a present value or a future value situation. This may not be very obvious at the surface, so this needs a bit more understanding. One easy way to figure that out is by analyzing the numbers. zerodha.com/varsity 29",

    "text": "30 We know the cost of education in 15 years will be Rs.6,500,000/-, so what is clear at this point is the future value of our cash requirement. Given this, we need to figure out the present value of this cash requirement, so that we can save an appropriate amount today. We can do this by the simple present value formula we just learned \u2013 Present value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) The 7.5%, 15 year Government bond is a good proxy for the discount rate, so we will use the same. Present value = 6,500,000/(1+7.5%)^(15) = Rs.21,96,779/- So in today\u2019s rate, if we can manage to deposit a sum of Rs.21,96,779/-, we will have the required target funds in 15 years. Of course, some of you reading this may be in an exact situation wherein you\u2019d be saving for your child\u2019s future education. Do note, this is not the only way to save for it. The different ways to accumulate that corpus is the objective of this module, but for now, we are only concerned about gaining clarity about the concept of the present value of money. Let us take up an example of the future value of money before we wrap this chapter up. Here is a situation you may be familiar \u2013 Question \u2013 Your dad\u2019s close friend at the office also doubles up as a wheeler-dealer, and never hesitates to offer a financial deal/scheme.

Answer \u2013 This is a tricky question because this can be solved by the application of both future value and present value concept. We will stick to the future value application. Quite straightforward this one \u2013 Investment required today \u2013 Rs.200,000/- Expected value from this investment \u2013 Rs.450,000/- Given this, and the 7.5% opportunity cost, we need to figure if this investment makes sense. We will extrapolate Rs.200,000/- at the opportunity cost to figure this. Future value = 200000*(1+7.5%)^15 = Rs. 591,775.5 Contrast this with the Rs.450,000/-, and the deal falls apart.

The risk-taking ability is merely a function of your knowledge and the way you continuously expand it. The more you read and understand, the more you get familiar with risk and the better equipped you are to handle risk. The extent of risk you assume can make or break your financial fortunes. Of course, we will discuss more as we proceed through this module. Common sense is something applicable to all aspect of life and not just finance; we will leave it at that \ud83d\ude42 So, given these three key points, we will now steer our way into learning the vast set of things that make up personal finance, and hopefully, this will help us develop our instincts on all the three counts required for success in personal finance. zerodha.com/varsity 33",

Hence, in my opinion, the best way to proceed is by identifying a real-life financial problem and then finding a solution for it. The process of finding the solution will open up many different learning windows, which will help us understand the core concepts of personal finance. So let\u2019s get started. I\u2019m assuming most of you would be in different stages of your working life, some would be starting (or about to begin your careers), some may be few years into work life, and others probably halfway through your work life. Regardless of where you are, one of the common goals in life is to ensure that you retire into a happy and content life. The fact that you have retired should not stop you from leading a particular desired lifestyle. You should continue to lead a lifestyle that you think you deserve. If the above is true, then it implies that you need the same amount of disposable income, as you would have when while you were working. Lesser disposable income wants a compromised post-retirement lifestyle, which none of us wants. zerodha.com/varsity 34",

Assume you will work for the next 25 years (these are your income-generating years), post which you will retire. A\u0000er you retire, you expect to live for say 20 more years. Assume, the cash required today to lead your lifestyle is Rs.50,000/- per month. This is cash post taxes, fixed expenses, utility bills, etc. This is your disposable income per month. The idea is that a\u0000er 25 years, for the next 20 years of your post-retirement life, you\u2019ll need the same Rs.50,000/- every month, this is about Rs.600,000/- per year. zerodha.com/varsity 35",

So if we were to accumulate a retirement corpus of 1.2Cr by the year 2044, we could easily sail through the next 20 years of post-retirement life by burning Rs.50,000/- per month, all the way to 2063. Well, if only life was that simple J Given the above, the question is, how much cash reserves you\u2019d need at the end of 25 years, i.e. in the year 2044, such that you can have Rs.50,000/- every month till the year 2064. In this chapter, we will address the required corpus bit and figure out the amount needed at the start of the retirement year. In the next section, we will figure out how this corpus gets generated. 4.2 \u2013 Inflation and other realities of life In the absence of inflation, the math above would work like a charm, i.e. in the year 2044, a sum of Rs.12,000,000/- would help us sail through our retirement years at ease, i.e. at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month up to 2064. However, inflation is real, and this makes life complicated in multiple ways. Inflation is the phenomenon, which makes things expensive. For example, a plate of pav bhaji at a restaurant may cost Rs.50/- today, but the same may cost Rs.55/- at the very same restaurant the next year. This marginal increase in cost is attributed to inflation. In other words, the purchasing power of money has reduced over one year. zerodha.com/varsity 37",

For this exact reason, we cannot only multiply the amount required with the number of years and arrive at a figure. 4.3 \u2013 The Future value To find a solution, we need to find out the Rs.50,000/- equivalent 25 years from now.

Remember, these are all the future value of money. 4.4 \u2013 Estimating the future value of the corpus To proceed further from this point and estimate the corpus required at the start of the retirement year, i.e. 2044, we need to have a view on the long-term inflation. I would be comfortable pegging the long-term average inflation value between 4-5%. Now, the question to answer is \u2013 given 5% inflation, what would be the value of Rs.600,000/- 25 years from now. Similarly, given 5% inflation, what would be the value of Rs.600,000/-, 26 years from now, so on and so forth, all the way to the 20 years of retirement. If you recollect from the previous chapter, we are talking about the future value calculation here. Once we have all the future values, we need to sum them up to get the total corpus required at the start of the retirement year.

The previous chapter helped us estimate (roughly) the corpus required for one to retire comfortably, without drastically changing the post-retirement lifestyle. One can argue that certain aspects were overlooked while estimating the post-retirement corpus, which is ok for now because this helps us determine the retirement corpus on a conservative basis. The idea, of course, is to understand personal finance so well that we can plugin things as we progress and eventually get the corpus number right. In the previous chapter, we figured that we need roughly 7Cr by retirement; in this chapter, we address the technique to generate the same. It must be quite evident to you by now that to create the retirement corpus by the target retirement year; we need to make investments starting today. The investments that we make today should ideally spread across multiple assets. This is called the multi-asset portfolio, which includes \u2013 fixed deposits, gold, real estate, equities, cash, and cash equivalents. The overall growth that you experience will then be an aggregate across all these assets. zerodha.com/varsity 44",

But here is an advise, when you work with predictions/projections of any sort in personal finance, always keep the number on a conservative basis. For example, frankly, I know equities, in the long run, will do much better than 11% CAGR, but I\u2019ll work with a 10-11% range. The advantage here is that you build a future based on conservative assumption, anything better is only a bonus. Anyway, the overall portfolio growth in the sum product of the weight of each asset and the expected return. Therefore \u2013 = 30% * 10% + 8% * 7% + 8% * 9% + 13% * 11% + 4%* 0 = 8.3% So as you can see, the combined (diversified) portfolio with multi-assets, generates an overall return of 8.3%. zerodha.com/varsity 46",

For the retirement problem, we will make one fundamental assumption. The assumption is that we will look at only equity for building the retirement corpus. The exposure to equity is in the form of making systematic investments in a growth-oriented equity mutual fund. If you do not understand \u2018systematic investments in a growth-oriented equity mutual fund\u2019, then do not worry. Going forward in this module, we will discuss this in detail. Since equity is the only asset we are dealing with in this retirement problem, we need to assign an expected growth rate to this asset. I think a 10-11% CARG is a fair expectation, especially when the holding period is long, i.e. more than ten plus years. So let\u2019s work with this number for now. 5.2 \u2013 The setup A quick recap of the retirement problem, before we proceed. In the previous chapter, we figured that we need funds to the tune of 7Crs to lead a comfortable retired life. We call this a retirement corpus. We defied \u2018comfortable\u2019 by ensuring we have at least Rs.50,000/- per month for the 20 years post-retirement. The next step is to figure out how one can generate a retirement corpus. Remember, we are starting our journey to save for retirement today, and we have 25 years to build this corpus. Twenty-five years is 300 months. zerodha.com/varsity 48",

They are \u2013 We have a steady job which pays us a salary every month We are employed until the year of our retirement Our primary savings vehicle is regular investments in equity mutual funds We get yearly hikes in our pay Every year we will increase the investments in equity mutual funds by 10% The increase in savings happens every January I know many of you may be concerned with these assumptions here, especially about the job and the hikes, but then, that\u2019s an underlying assumption, without which we cannot proceed \ud83d\ude42 So how do these assumptions translate to action?

The 2 nd row reads similar \u2013 Its February, I\u2019m making the 2 nd savings installment for the year, i.e. Rs.5000/-. Retirement is now 299 months away. I want you to recognize the fact that the \u2018months away\u2019 can be looked at from a different perspective. If you realize, these are the number of months during which your money can grow. For example, the very first installment you make has the luxury to build (or compound) for 300 full months. The next month\u2019s savings can grow only for 299 months, 3 rd installment has only 298 months to grow. So on and so forth. Now, the 5 th and 6 th assumptions state that we are increasing the savings rate by 10% every January. This means, if we are starting with Rs.5000/- for year 1, the 2 nd year we bump this up by 10%, hence for the 2 nd year we invest Rs.5,500/-. This is how it looks \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 50",

So what would be the value of this investment at the end of 300 months? Well, by now, you should recognize that we can apply the concept of the future value of money and get the answer. The future value of money formula is \u2013 Future value = P*(1+R)^(n) Where, Principal ( P ) = Rs.5000 Growth rate ( R ) = 11% per annum Time ( n ) = 300 months. However, this formula considers time in years. Hence we need to express 300 months in years, therefore 300/12 = 25 = 5000*(1+11%)^(300/12) =Rs.67,927/- Let us do this for the 2 nd installment as well; everything stays the same except for the time component \u2013 = 5000*(1+11%)^(299/12) = Rs.67,339/- This is how the table looks \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 52",

Well, unfortunately, you do not have many options expect to save large chunks of your cash flow. But remember, this entire conversation is an oversimplification to help us get started. There are many angles to this story. For example, you may acquire property by inheritance, which earns you a rental income for the rest of your life or you can get a huge lump sum amount at retirement, thanks to PF and stuff. This retirement amount gets parked in a savings account or a fixed deposit, which gives you yearly cash flow.

You can skip this chapter if you know what a mutual fund is. Before we start learning about Mutual funds, I\u2019d like to digress a bit and narrate a personal story dating back to 2008-09. I\u2019m not sure how many of you reading this were trading, investing, tracking or remotely connected to the stock markets in the year 2008. The year 2008 was very interesting (perhaps scary) for people sitting on the sidelines and watching all the action, but for people involved and had their livelihoods tied to the market, 2008 was apocalyptic. The financial services industry was in absolute pits, and I was in the city of London, which was the epicentre of the financial meltdown. I was relatively new in the industry, had very few industry connections, and hardly any working experience in the UK. When the industry-wide job cuts started, I knew it would be me sooner or later. The good thing was I just dint sit on the sideline wondering if I would get the layoff notice. I knew it was a matter of time. Given the situation, I had decided to head back to India. Of course, not that there many options for me to choose. By Feb 2009, I was back in Bangalore, luckily I found myself a spot to sit and trade the markets with the (now) legendary Kamath Associates (pre-Zerodha zerodha.com/varsity 59",

The capital to trade was mainly my own plus a bit from my close circle. While trading was something I enjoyed, I found investing super interesting. I spent a lot of time reading the annual reports and understanding of businesses. This effort included learning a bit of accounting to help me read the company\u2019s financial statements. I soon realized that stock picking and building long-term equity portfolio was something that I wanted to for a living. I slowly branched out from active trading and started building an investing practice. I moved out of Kamath Associates to do this full time. Of course, at that point, Kamath Associates dissolved and Nithin Kamath started Zerodha. Over time I built a carefully cra\u0000ed equity portfolio for myself. I had a thesis for each investment made. I was aware of the growth drivers and the risk parameters for each stock I had invested. While I started doing this for myself, I soon extended my help in setting up an equity portfolio for my family members and later to my close friends. I had few things going right for me and soon people around me and their immediate circle knew I was a good option to consider for equity investing. It was in November 2010, that I decided to do this as a profession. My idea was to help people build an equity portfolio, manage it on their behalf, grow it, review it periodically, assess the risk, and do everything possible with a single point agenda \u2013 to help them generate wealth over a long period. zerodha.com/varsity 60",

I continued my journey, by 2012, I was fortunate enough to onboard a bunch of clients and managed a decent sum of money. I was taking an independent decision on which stock to invest in and which stocks to exit. I was deciding how much to invest in each stock and for how long. On the first Saturday of every month, I\u2019d send a report to all my clients informing them of how their portfolio was performing in the market. I was indeed a fund manager for at least 20-25 families, and I felt happy and responsible being in that position. However, there was a problem lurking. As per the regulators, i.e. SEBI, anyone aspiring to be a fund manager and manage portfolios, had to procure a license from SEBI. This license is called the \u2018Portfolio Management Service\u2019 (PMS) license. Probably I\u2019ll discuss PMS later in the module.

Not a grain of salt or sugar varies from one pack to another. It is a highly standardized offering. Britannia is a large-scale baker, with a distribution network across the country. The baker in your neighborhood is a local baker, with the residents as his loyal customers. He does not have a distribution network like Britannia. Now think about my \u2018fund management\u2019 affair, I guess you would agree that I was comparable to the local baker, catering to a small set of customers in the neighborhood. On similar lines, there are \u201cfund managers\u201d, on a large-scale basis who can cater to millions of customers and offer the same service to each one of these customers. Customers in the fund management context are people who are looking for \u2018fund management\u2019, services. These large-scale fund managers typically operate via a mutual fund structure.

There are prerequisites to set up an AMC and these prerequisites are laid down by \u2018The Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019 (SEBI). SEBI is the governing authority for all the AMCs in India. SEBI holds the rights to grant or not grant the AMC license to a corporate body. The process of setting up and AMC is highly stringent and rightfully so. A\u0000er all, there is a large scale public money at stake and the regulators need to ensure this money is managed by responsible entities. In their effort to bring in transparency and accountability, SEBI has proposed a multi-tier structure for an AMC.

The fund sponsor has to follow the 2 stage application process by furnishing all the details SEBI would require. At the end of stage 1, SEBI either denies the licenses or grants an \u2018in principle\u2019, approval for the same. Once the in-principal approval is issued, SEBI demands more documents and details for further scrutiny. Finally, a\u0000er the stringent due diligence process, SEBI can again decide to either grant or deny the AMC license to the fund sponsor. Trustees \u2013 Once the fund sponsor procures the license from SEBI, they need to register a trust and appoint a board of trustees. The trust ensures that the AMC formed by the fund sponsor carries out its duties in the right spirit and works in the interest of the clients of the AMC (unit holders). SEBI also mandates that the trustee of the fund is independent and not associated with the sponsor in any way. AMC \u2013 The trust in consultation with the fund sponsor appoints an AMC. The AMC is also called the \u2018Investment Manager\u2019. The role of the AMC is to float a mutual fund and manage the different investment schemes of the AMC. The AMC houses a chief investment officer (CIO), fund managers, analysts, and everyone responds to run and manage the mutual fund. The AMC is responsible for the operation and management of different mutual fund schemes, in compliance with the SEBI\u2019s rules and regulations.

Although not essential, I believe that the understanding of the Mutual fund structure will help you at some point in your investment journey. Moving ahead, we direct our efforts to learn more about Mutual fund investing. We will learn about the different fund category, fund analysis, fund schemes, and many other things associated with mutual fund investment. Now, before we learn these concepts, we need to understand a fundamental concept. From my observation, I\u2019ve noticed that many people get a bit lost when we use the term \u2018fund\u2019 in the context of a mutual fund. So before we start digging deeper into the mutual fund concepts, we must get complete clarity on what the term \u2018fund\u2019 means. I will take the liberty to simplify many things in this chapter; the simplifications in this chapter are only to help you get the context right. So let us started, and as usual, let us build an imaginary story to help relate to the topic better. Now, think of yourself as the stock market whiz-kid in your family.

As expected, soon, your uncles, aunts, and cousins approach you to help them manage their money. The quasi fund manager status that you have achieved for yourself has gotten you all excited. The question is \u2013 how will you manage this money? Going strictly by regulations, unless you hold the license for fund management, like the PMS license we discussed in the previous chapter, you cannot manage other people\u2019s money. Given this, assume that you apply for a fund management license and eventually procure one from SEBI. Now, you are all set to render your fund management services to your family members and hopefully soon to many others outside the family. Your family members are happy and are eager to reap the benefits of your fund management skills. The following family members approach you with their money.

In total, across these five individuals, you have managed to pool in Rs.275,000/-. Before you get started, you need to set a few expectations \u2013 All investors are treated fairly in terms of return generated You are permitted to treat these individuals differ in terms of service provided. For example, the aunt has invested the highest amount, so maybe when she visits, you can give her coffees and cookies, while the nephew has invested the least, so you can decide not to offer the coffee and cookies The above two are critical points, let us spend a bit more time to rivet it. Imagine you and I walk into a restaurant. You are a regular at the restaurant have been to the restaurant multiple times and have generated enough business for the restaurant.

On the other hand, I\u2019d be served with regular cutlery and treated like a regular customer. However we both get to eat the same dish, no difference there. So you as a fund manager can differentiate between customers on how much they have invested, but should certainly not differentiate and generate two different returns for two different customers based on how much they have invested. They all should experience the same returns. In fact, in the mutual fund world, this gets further streamlined in terms of investment objectives, mandates, and other things. We will get to that in the next chapter. Anyway, now that the expectations are in place, it now boils down to logistic arrangements on how this money gets managed. To manage this money, you now ask your family members to transfer all the money into one single account. The idea is to pool all the money in the same account and use that to make investments in the market. Since it\u2019s all pooled into one account, that account holding the funds belongs to all. Think of this as a rationale as to why \u2018Mutual funds\u2019 are called \u2018Mutual\u2019 Funds. 7.2 \u2013 The fund logistics As a fund manager, it is your responsibility to ensure that those funds are invested in the stock market, and it grows at a healthy rate.

While you do this, you need to ensure that every investor of yours is given the same treatment in terms of wealth creation. Remember, you are pooling all individual monies and investing it as a whole aka a fund. So the return experienced by the investors should be uniform. So given this, how do we ensure we have an equitable distribution of returns across all the clients? To do this, we can start by issuing shares against the investment made by each investor. We can start by assigning a notional value to each of these shares. This notional value or the initial value can be anything, and you can assign 5,10,50, or even 100 as the starting value. It does not matter. The most popular notional value if Rs.10, so we will stick to that. We now issue Rs.10/- notional value shares to all our investors and estimate the number of shares each investor holds. For example, the uncle has invested Rs.65,000/-, so he gets \u2013 = 65,000/10 = 6500 shares. The table now looks like this \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 75",

Alright, now that the fund is formed and shares distributed across clients, the fund manager gets to work on things he is best at, i.e. to pick stocks and invest the money. As a fund manager, you decide to invest the funds, i.e. Rs.275,000/- across ten stocks. For the sake of simplicity, you choose to invest the same amount across all the ten stocks. The distribution of funds in this manner is referred to as the \u2018equally distributed portfolio\u2019. The total corpus is Rs.275,000/-, so each stock gets an investment of Rs.27,500/-.

The number of shares is proportional to the individual investment made The funds are invested in the markets across ten different stocks Now, once the funds are entirely invested in the market, the value of the overall fund depends on how the shares perform daily. A few stocks can go up, and a few can come down, resulting in either a profit or a loss. This profit and loss should be passed to the investors. The quantum of profit or loss experienced by the investors is directly dependent on the amount of money each investor has invested in the fund. Let\u2019s continue the example to see how the P&L pass through happens. I\u2019ve randomly assigned percentage movement to all these stocks.

The profit of Rs.2,844/- has to be distributed across all the five investors in proportion to their investments. To ensure a fair distribution, all we need to do is, ensure the notional value goes up (or down) by the same percentage as the fund, which is 1.0340% in this case. Initial notional value (day 1) \u2013 10 P&L % in funds \u2013 1.0340% New notional value (day 2) \u2013 10 *(1+1.0340%) = 10.1034 So, the new notional value is 10.1034, multiplying this with the number of shares should result in the new investment value for the investor. As you can see, the investment for each of the investors has gone up by the same percentage point, but the absolute money made by them differs, based on the initial investment amount.

We discussed the idea of \u2018pooling of funds\u2019 to invest in the market with a common purpose. I agree we oversimplified the previous chapter, but that\u2019s ok as the objective at this point is to understand the fund structure and the way it serves its investors.

The mutual fund NAV or the mutual fund unit is an elementary concept, and I hope you have no confusion about this. If yes, I would urge you to read the previous chapter once again. We will, in this chapter, take that conversation forward and look at one of the most crucial documents from a fund house, i.e. the Fund fact sheet. The factsheet is a document that puts up all the information related to a fund/scheme. By and large, everything that you need to know before investing in a particular fund is available in the fund fact sheet.

Each fund house (AMC), can run multiple schemes for people to invest. For example, ICICI Pru AMC runs 243 different schemes, probably the highest in the industry.

Out of this 25.68L Crs, roughly 14.5L Cr is from retail investors like you and me, and about 12L Crs is from the corporates The number of unique Investors \u2013 2 Crs Indians. This is the number of individual investors investing in Mutual funds schemes across all the AMCs. Again, these are good to know numbers to put things in some perspective. You need not have to know these numbers if your objective is to invest in the markets via mutual funds. 8.2 \u2013 The fund factsheet An asset management company (AMC), manages and runs a mutual fund scheme. An AMC can run many schemes as long as they have SEBI\u2019s approval for it. A mutual fund scheme is essentially a fund with a specific investment objective. An investment objective is the stated goal of the fund. For example, the investment objective of a mutual fund scheme could be an investment in the top 100 large-cap companies in the country or it could be an investment in the top 100 small-cap companies, so on and so forth. The investment objective is stated at the inception of the fund, and the fund manager is expected to stick to this mandate until the life of the fund. So let us pick a fund fact sheet and dig into what information is available to us. Let us start with Kotak AMC.

This is required to evaluate the performance of the fund over a period. A mutual fund should have the appropriate benchmark. For example, a small-cap fund is benchmarked against a small-cap index, as in this case.

There are three critical parameters here; let us understand what it means. Open-ended \u2013 When an AMC starts a fund, they have the option to let that fund run for either a fixed period or keep it going forever. For example, I can start a fund today and let it run for three years from today, at the end of 3 rd year, the fund will cease to exist, and the investor is obligated to collect his money back (along with the profit or losses). Funds with such defined time are called a \u2018 closes ended fund \u2019. If a fund does not have an expiry date, then it\u2019s called an open-ended fund. For all practical purposes, its always good to deal with an open-ended fund Equity \u2013 This is a reference to the asset class the mutual fund invests. Equity, as you know, refers to the shares listed in the market. Another asset class is debt, which could be either corporate debt or PSU debt. More on this when we deep dive into debt funds Growth \u2013 Let us skip this for now. We will discuss this in a bit. Apart from this, this section also details a few other things \u2013 Fund Manager \u2013 I find this interesting to know who is managing the fund.

Under plans, there are two variants \u2013 Regular plan \u2013 This is interesting. Think about a farmer growing onions. He nurtures the onion saplings, waters it, weeds it, and eventually harvests it and gets the onion ready for consumption. Let us say the cost of the onion is about Rs.30/- per Kg at this point. An intermediary now acts as an \u2018agent\u2019 and delivers the onion to people like you and me, and we, in turn, pay him Rs.40/- per Kg. The delta (Rs.10), is what the agent earns. Now replace the farmer with the AMC, the onions with a fund/scheme, and the agent as a mutual fund distributor. The mutual fund distributor is like the middleman between the AMC and the investor. If a mutual fund distributor approaches you and sells you a mutual fund, then he is selling you a \u2018regular plan\u2019, which means he is entitled to receive a commission from the AMC for selling this fund to you. There is nothing wrong with this, except that the money is going from your pocket. Direct plan \u2013 Now you don\u2019t need to buy the fund via a distributor. If you know which fund to buy, capable of doing your mutual fund research (which by the way is the end objective of this module), then you can buy that fund directly from the AMC.

    "text": "90 means you save on commissions, which naturally means a better return on your investment. Just to let you know, when you buy mutual funds via Zerodha, you are buying a direct plan; hence you will enjoy a better return. We will deep dive into this topic later in this module, but for now, remember when you invest in mutual funds, opt for a direct plan as you will save on commissions and therefore enjoy the better return. The other bit in this section is about the option. As you can see, this fund has two options \u2013 Dividend payout \u2013 Think about it, when you buy a stock of a company and the company issues a dividend, then as an investor, you are entitled to receive these dividends right? Likewise, when the fund manager buys the stock of a company, and the company issues a dividend, then the AMC receives this divided. Since the funds with the AMC belongs to the investors, this dividend belongs to the investors. The dividend you are entitled to obtain from the AMC is to the extent you\u2019ve invested in the fund. The AMC gives you two options \u2013 you can withdraw this dividend, or you can choose to reinvest the dividend amount and buy more units of the fund. The dividend payout option helps you withdraw the dividend as and when the dividend gets paid. There are technicalities here as to how the AMCs issue dividends. We will discuss this at a later point. Dividend reinvestment plan \u2013 This plan receives the dividend on your behalf and reinvests the dividend into the same fund. So necessarily, you don\u2019t get the dividend in the form of cash, but instead more units or NAV of the same fund. zerodha.com/varsity 90",

    "text": "91 Growth plan \u2013 In the growth plan, the investor does not receive any dividends. The profits earned are ploughed back to fund and therefore the \u2018compounding effect\u2019, works well here. I personally prefer this plan over the other two. Next up is the SIP details. SIP stands for \u2018systematic investment plan\u2019. In a typical SIP, you will invest the same amount of money every month for as many years as possible. Example of a SIP is investing say Rs.5000/- in Kotak Small-cap fund on 5 th of every month for as many months as possible. Think of SIP as investing in instalments. SIP is perhaps one of the most significant financial inventions and has many merits to it. Given the importance of this topic, I think a separate chapter on this topic is justified, and we will do that at a later point. For now, think of SIP in its basic form, i.e. to invest a fixed amount of money every month in the same fund for many years. As you can see, you can SIP on Kotak Small-cap fund, but for that, the AMC has specified that the minimum SIP amount every month is Rs.1000/- and the minimum number of months is six. The next section talks about the initial minimum investment in the fund. This is self-explanatory, if you choose not to SIP, then the minimum amount to invest is Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- for the monthly SIP. The last section of the fact sheet talks about the load structure of the fund. There is a mention of few terms here like the SIP, STP, switches etc. We will club all these in the SIP chapter. For now, let\u2019s talk about the \u2018load structure\u2019. The load structure is essentially the amount of money, in percentage terms; you will have to pay in case you wish to withdraw from the fund. As you can see, there are two types of load structure \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 91",

I guess AMC\u2019s have to mention \u2018entry load\u2019 as nil for legacy reasons. Exit load \u2013 This is the amount of money you will have to pay at the time of withdrawal. As you can see, there is a 1% load if you wish to withdraw before the completion of 1 year and no-load post that. 8.4 \u2013 Riskometer Every AMC is supposed to self-asses the riskiness of the fund and lets the customers know about this. The self-assessment is something that SEBI mandates to avoid cases of the misspelling of the financial product. For example, a small-cap fund should not be packaged as a low-risk fund and sold to the investors. Here is how the AMC does a self-assessment of risk \u2013 The needle of the riskometer points to \u2018moderately high\u2019, meaning that the Kotak Smallcap fund is risky. The text next to the riskometer reiterates this. Now, agreed this is a risky fund, but that should not stop you from investing in risky funds. Remember, the antidote for \u2018risk\u2019 in the mutual fund world is \u2018time\u2019; hence the longer you stay invested in a mutual fund, the safer it gets. zerodha.com/varsity 92",

The factsheet lists some of the good to know information about a mutual fund. Do remember, the factsheet also doubles up as a marketing document for the Asset Management Company (AMC), hence read through the fund\u2019s factsheet with a pinch of salt. Starting from this chapter, we will shi\u0000 our focus on the mutual fund categories. The idea is to discuss the main categories and a few subcategories of mutual funds. Please note, the term \u2018subcategory\u2019 in the context of mutual fund categories does not exist, but I think it makes life simpler if you thought about the mutual fund categories this way. I\u2019m not sure if we can cover all the subcategories in this module. For example, Debt fund as a main mutual fund category has nearly 16 different subcategories, equity as a category has about 10/11 subcategories. Given this, as you can imagine, discussing the entire gamut of MF categories will digress us from the central theme of this module which is personal finance. The idea here is to lay down a foundation for you to understand the main mutual fund category (and a few subcategories) and hopefully, this zerodha.com/varsity 94",

No discussion on the mutual fund universe is complete without touching upon the SEBI\u2019s October 2017 circular on MF categorisation. This circular from SEBI was fairly significant, and it helped simplify the MF universe. To appreciate why this SEBI circular is essential, we need to dig up a bit of history. Back in the days, the mutual fund world was a bit chaotic. The asset management companies would float many different schemes with overlapping investment ideologies. These funds would o\u0000en confuse or mislead investors. For example, an AMC would run a \u2018large-cap fund\u2019, which by definition should predominantly have only large-cap stock, but these AMCs would stuff in small-cap stocks, which as you can imagine bumps up the volatility (and the return) of the fund. A typical large-cap investor would sign up for the market returns plus lower volatility, but the presence of small-cap stocks in a large-cap fund kind of defeats the purpose. Here are a bunch of other problems that existed pre-Oct 2017; these problems existed mainly due to the lack of proper mutual fund classifications and definitions. Multiple funds \u2013 An AMC would launch numerous funds with similar investment objectives. For instance, it was common for an AMC to have multiple large-cap or mid-cap schemes, while all these funds had the same investment objective. The distinction between the funds was not too clear. Lack of definition \u2013 While an AMC would title their scheme as a large or mid-cap fund, it would contain stocks from other market capitalisation. The zerodha.com/varsity 95",

    "text": "96 problem occurred because there was no formal definition of market capitalisation. Portfolio composition \u2013 The mutual fund schemes lacked a clear definition in terms of portfolio composition. For instance, the portfolio of a mid-cap fund is expected to hold mid-cap stocks, but it was common to find funds with a large proportion of small-cap stocks while the name of the fund suggested the fund was a mid-cap focused fund. These problems led to a series of other issues. One of the major concerns was with benchmarking of funds. A large-cap fund is benchmarked against a Ni\u0000y 50 index; now we have a problem if a fund with small-cap stocks gets disguised as a large-cap fund and gets benchmarked against a large-cap index. The performance of such a \u2018large-cap fund\u2019 (at least in bull markets) is bound to get skewed and offers an abnormal positive return, o\u0000en misleading the investor. SEBI addressed these problems with the Oct 2017 circular. You can find the original circular here. The circular clearly defined the market capitalisation of stock, which naturally solved a few legacy issues in the mutual fund world. As per the definition \u2013 Large-cap stocks \u2013 1 st to 100 th company in terms of full market capitalisation Mid-cap stocks - 101 st to 250 th company in terms of full market capitalisation Small-cap stocks \u2013 250 th company onwards in terms of full market capitalisation With this formal definition, there was no longer ambiguity on the market capitalization, and the AMCs were now forced to comply with the definitions. zerodha.com/varsity 96",

This mandate put a stop to AMCs offering a bouquet of schemes with an overlapping investment thesis. To make things clear, SEBI defined the portfolio composition as well. To put this context, post the circular, if an AMC were to run a large-cap fund, then SEBI not only defined what large-cap is but also set the minimum number of large-cap stocks (in % terms) the fund should hold in its portfolio. Anyway, let us jump to the different mutual fund categories and subcategories and start exploring them. The idea here is to understand these categories and invest in them based on our financial situation in life. 9.2 \u2013 The Mutual fund universe Primarily, there are five different categories of mutual funds under which there are many different categories. Think of them as a \u2018category \u2013 subcategory\u2019 way of classification. Here are the main categories \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 97",

Other schemes The entire \u2018category \u2013 subcategory\u2019 structure is as follows \u2013 To begin with, we will focus on Equity as a category. As per SEBI\u2019s circular, an AMC is supposed to run only one scheme per category. For example, an AMC can have only one large-cap, one mid-cap, one small-cap so and so forth. However, under Equity, an AMC can have multiple sectoral funds. 9.3 \u2013 Equity Category The equity category is perhaps the most popular MF category in terms of retail participation. As the name suggests, the schemes under the equity category invest in listed company shares. As you are aware, there are many different styles of investment in the market. A few of these popular styles have been picked and formally inducted into the \u2018Equity category\u2019.

    "text": "99 the Equity category. Each of these categories is a different style of investing in the market, and they all differ in their risk and reward characteristics. However, the general philosophy of investing in an equity scheme remains the same, i.e. to generate wealth. What differs across these categories is essentially the timeline of this wealth generation and like I mentioned, the risk and reward. Over the years, thanks to my profession, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to interact with many people about mutual fund investing. One thing that I can tell you with confidence is that most of them approach mutual fund investing (at least in the equity funds) with unrealistic expectations. Some even go to the extent of looking at mutual funds as a proxy for direct stock investing. They almost have a trading attitude with their funds. Such an approach to mutual fund investing can have dangerous consequences for your capital. Unless you have the right expectation and attitude towards equity investing, it is nearly impossible to generate wealth from mutual fund investing. So what is the right expectation/attitude when investing in an equity-oriented mutual fund. Well, the true answer to this question depends on the exact subcategory of the mutual fund you are looking at. However, here are a few generic pitfalls to avoid \u2013 Not a short term solution \u2013 Equity oriented mutual funds are not a solution for your short term financial goals. By short term, I mean 2-3 years kind of time frame. Invest in equity-oriented funds only if you have the necessary time it deserves. To put this in context, I started investing in an equity mutual fund in 2006, it is the 14 th year as of 2020, and I continue to invest in it. I\u2019m not zerodha.com/varsity 99",

    "text": "100 suggesting that you need to stay invested for this long a period, all I\u2019m trying to say is that you need to have a super long term approach to mutual funds. I\u2019d say at least ten plus years (my personal opinion). Anything lower than this can be a futile attempt at wealth creation. Why not short term? \u2013 One of the common follow up questions is why not consider equity mutual fund for short term investments. Well, there have been instances where short term mutual fund returns have swelled. It requires a great amount of market study to figure and time this. Now, if you as a common man investing in the market can time the market, then why invest in mutual funds at all? You may as well invest in stocks directly, right? Understand time \u2013 You may have heard of the saying, \u2018time heals everything\u2019. Well, this is true for market volatility as well. The market is volatile; this is the very nature of this beast. However, the only way for a common man to deal with volatility is to give your investment sufficient time. Hence, a short term approach to MF investing does not work. Don\u2019t keep switching \u2013 I\u2019ve seen investors switch between mutual funds as they would switch between their browsing tabs. Switching is essentially redeeming the units from \u2018Fund A\u2019 to invest in \u2018Fund B\u2019, for no real reasons. In my opinion, this cannot be packaged as long term investing. The true definition of long term investing is staying invested in a fund across a multi-year period (and across multiple market cycles). Of course, occasionally there will be justifiable reasons for you to switch between funds, we will identify these reasons at a later point. Headline investing \u2013 Most investors get carried away by newspaper headlines. A headline which remotely hints at \u2018bearishness\u2019, is taken way too seriously and used as a reason to exit an ongoing mutual fund investments. zerodha.com/varsity 100",

Trust me; you will do far better than most of the investing public if you understand these basic points which make a big difference to your investing journey.

At a later stage, I\u2019ll share my thoughts on this topic related to asset allocation and fund diversification.

As you may have noticed, the name of these subcategories is quite descriptive and gives out a general idea about what to expect from such a fund. Large-cap fund \u2013 As the name suggests, a large-cap equity fund indicates that the fund invests predominantly in large-cap stocks. These are the top 100 companies in India, with the largest market capitalisation. The expectation is that these companies are also market leaders in the industry they belong to. These companies are also supposed to be stable and safe. Examples of large-cap stocks include companies like TCS, Reliance, Infosys, HDFC Bank, etc. Have a look at the portfolio of one of the large-cap mutual fund schemes. This is the portfolio of Axis Bluechip fund \u2013 As you can see, the portfolio predominantly contains large-cap stocks (80%), invested in varying proportions. The weight assigned to each stock is the fund manager\u2019s prerogative.

Usually, when an investor decides to invest in a large-cap fund, he has a twin agenda \u2013 (1) capital appreciation in line with the markets, (2) low volatility. By low volatility here, I mean with respect to small and mid-cap funds. In simple words, this means that the investor is looking at wealth creation but with not so much risk to his capital. Do remember, these are large-cap stocks, meant to be stable hence less volatile. Of course, by virtue of investing in the stock market either directly or via a mutual fund, the capital is exposed to volatility. Like I mentioned earlier, the only antidote to volatility is time. So it goes without saying that you need to stay invested for a long period to factor in the volatility and generate decent returns. Here is a look at how the top large-cap mutual funds have performed over the last ten years. I\u2019ve defined \u2018top\u2019, by considering the size of the fund\u2019s AUM. I\u2019ve taken this data from Moneycontrol \u2013 The key point to note here is the positive return across all the funds against a long investment horizon. zerodha.com/varsity 103",

The mid-cap fund predominantly consists of mid-cap stocks and the small-cap funds contain small-cap companies. The volatility in mid and small-cap stocks is quite high. Like the large-cap stocks, investment in these funds should be long term. You cannot afford to invest on a short term basis in these funds. For example, here is how the small and mid-cap funds have performed over the last two years \u2013 The last two years have been particularly bad for the small and mid-cap stocks, and this is evident across the fund\u2019s returns. I\u2019m not trying to say that the returns across all two years or three years (or any short term cycle) will always be bad. It depends on the market; however, for a common man, it is nearly impossible to time the market and calls the cycles. Hence when we invest, we should have a long term agenda, or at least have the intent to stay invested for the long term.

    "text": "105 All the funds have delivered a fairly decent positive return. Also, notice the ten-year performance of small and mid-cap funds are better than the large-cap funds; this should be evident to you because small and mid-cap funds are more volatile compared to large-cap funds. The intent behind investing in either of these funds is the same as large-cap i.e. wealth creation over a long period. However, you expect a return much higher than a large-cap fund (against much higher volatility). This is obvious because the fund contains companies which have a long headroom for growth. As the company grows, so would the returns. The large and mid-cap fund is a cocktail of both mid and large-cap stocks. Unlike an exclusive large/mid/small-cap fund, the \u2018large & mid\u2019 cap fund is expected to have 35% of its investment in large-cap and another 35% in mid-cap stocks. For example, this DSP large and mid-cap fund has stocks like Infosys, Airtel, HDFC Bank, and also, stocks like Hexaware, Hatsun Agro, and V Guard. Technically the fund can be a 65% large (or mid) and 35% mid (or large) cap stocks. The extent of the skew depends on the fund manager. Since the large and mid-cap fund is a mixed bag, the expectation on the return front is slightly higher than a regular large-cap fund but lower than a small-cap fund. The risk is higher than a large-cap fund but lower compared to mid or small-cap fund. Here is how the returns for small and mid-cap stack up for the last ten years \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 105",

Given the fact that the multi-cap fund has a mix of market capitalization, the return expectation is on the higher side. The higher return expectation is also associated with a higher risk.

Unfortunately, in the Indian stock markets, the liquidity in the small-cap space is not much, hence the fund is forced to invest the funds in large and mid-cap funds. Hence, as the asset base grows, a Multi cap fund tends to work like a large and mid-cap fund. This probably explains why the SBI Multicap fund (8.5K Crore in AUM) has nearly 70% of its investments in large-cap stocks. The one thing you need to keep in mind when investing in a multi-cap fund is the \u2018fund manager\u2019 risk. Since the fund invests in stocks across the spectrum, the performance is largely dependent on the kind of stocks and the proportion the fund manager decides to invest. By the way, in my opinion, if you are completely new to mutual funds and don\u2019t know where to start and which category to pick, then I\u2019d suggest you start with a multi-cap fund. Think of this as going for a buffet dinner, where you get a bit of everything. 10.2 \u2013 Focused Funds We have discussed a few equity categories by now. I hope you\u2019ve looked at the fact sheet and portfolio composition of some of the funds. If you have, then one thing that comes across quite evidently is the number of stocks in the portfolio. It is very common for equity mutual funds to have a large portfolio size (in terms of the number of stocks), the numbers average to about 60-70 stocks in a typical equity portfolio. The common theory is that the higher the number of stocks, the lower is your risk (and of course the return). zerodha.com/varsity 112",

The moment you see \u2018dividend yield\u2019 as a part of the fund\u2019s name, it is only natural to expect that the mutual fund pays out regular dividends to its investors. However, this is not true at all. A dividend yield fund (or for that matter any other mutual fund) is under no obligation to pay out a dividend to its investors. Given this, why do you think a dividend yield fund is called a dividend yield fund? Well, the name is representative of the strategy the fund follows. The strategy as you can imagine involves investing in companies that payout (high)` dividends regularly. Dividend yield = Dividend paid during the year/ stock price For example, if Infosys trading at Rs.780/- per share pays a dividend of Rs.22/- for the year, then Infosys\u2019s dividend yield is \u2013 = 22/780 = 2.8% Here is SEBI\u2019s definition for this category \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 115",

So one has to define what \u2018high dividend\u2019 really means. The lack of clear definition leads to inconsistencies in-stock selection. For example, a fund manager simply states that high dividend yield is anything greater than 0.75% and another fund manager may want to benchmark it against the indices dividend yield.

As you may be aware, section 80C in the income tax act allows you to reduce your tax burden by accommodating for certain investments and payments made during the financial year, the reduction in the tax burden, however, is up to Rs.1,50,000/- per year. For example, if you have a total gross yearly income of Rs.1,200,000/- then you can choose to invest Rs.1,50,000/- in various 80C options and reduce the tax burden. If you do so, your taxable income reduces to 1,050,000/-. Amongst the various investment options permitted under section 80C, investments in ELSS mutual fund is one of them. You can choose to invest either the entire permitted amount of Rs.1,50,000/- in ELSS or split this amount across many different schemes such as Life Insurance, Public Provident Fund, five year FD, Sukanya Smariddi Yojana, etc. The decision to do so depends on your overall financial planning strategy.

The debt funds play an essential role in the investor\u2019s portfolio, and it serves a variety of purposes, including capital protection. Before we understand how and when to use a debt fund, we need to understand a more fundamental concept, i.e. the origin of debt. To help you understand this, I\u2019ll take the example of a simple debt structure, which I guess we all would have come across directly or indirectly in our daily lives. So let\u2019s get started. Assume you want to buy an apartment. You do your research and shop around for the apartment with a checklist. After an exhaustive search, you eventually circle in on your dream apartment.

You have 40L stashed away in your bank, which suffices as the down payment. You still need 1.1Cr to fund the property purchase. How will you source the additional fund? Chances are, you will approach a bank and request for a loan. The bank evaluates your request and either give you a loan or denies the loan. Needless to say, before deciding to provide you with a loan, the bank will do a ton of background work and dig up every bit of information about you. One of the critical inputs for the bank is your credit score issued by agencies such as CIBIL or Experian. The credit score is a reflection of your creditworthiness, higher the rating the better it is for you and of course, a low credit score implies no loan or a loan at an exorbitant interest rate. So let us just assume that you have a fantastic credit score and the bank decides to give you a loan of 1.1Cr against your apartment purchase. The details of your loan are as follows \u2013 Credit score: 850 Amount : Rs.1,10,00,000/- Tenure: 10 years or 120 months Interest rate: 8.5% Total interest payable : Rs.53,66,129/- Total payable \ue081Int + Principal) : Rs.1,63,66,129/- Monthly EMI\ue092 Rs.1,36, 384/- zerodha.com/varsity 125",

Of course, the credit score is arbitrary here \ud83d\ude42 These details, along with a bunch of terms and conditions are printed on a document. A stamp paper is attached with stamp duty paid, and the document is registered. Finally, both the parties sign off. A document such as this is called a loan agreement. Finally, the loan amount is credited from the bank to your bank account. The apartment will remain hypothecated to the bank till the entire loan amount is repaid. The hypothecation works as backup security for the bank. In case you refuse to repay the loan, the bank can sell your apartment and make good their principal and interest. From the bank\u2019s perspective, the loan is a \u2018collateralised loan\u2019, because the loan is secured against collateral, i.e. the property in this case. A collateralised loan is a safer bet for the bank as opposed to a non-collateralised loan. At this point, I want you to recognise how a debt obligation is created. A debt obligation is created when a person needs to carry out an economic activity for which the fund requirement is far higher than what is available to him. Going back to the apartment case, assuming things go smoothly, on every month, for the next ten years the borrower is expected to pay back a sum of, i.e. Rs.1,36, 384/- to the bank. The regular inflow to the bank is the \u2018cash flow\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 126",

By risk, I mean the risk involved for the banker, i.e. the lender. What do you think can give the lender sleepless night? There are a couple of things that can go wrong \u2013 Cashflow risk \u2013 The borrower can skip paying a couple of EMIs and make irregular repayments. Irregular repayments mean that the bank will take a hit on the expected cash flow, potentially leading to a chain of undesirable events Default risk \u2013 The borrower may get into an insolvent situation wherein servicing the loan becomes very difficult; hence the borrower decides not to repay. This is called \u2018default\u2019 or the \u2018default risk\u2019. Interest rate risk \u2013 The loan is given out at a specific interest rate. However, the economic situation may change, and the interest rates may drop in the future. This means that the bank will be forced to reduce the rates, and hence the expected cash flow takes a hit. Credit rating risk \u2013 The bank evaluates the borrower\u2019s credit rating at the time of giving out the loan. At this point, the borrower\u2019s credit rating could be excellent. However, for whatever reasons, the credit rating of the borrower can suddenly degrade, thereby increasing the chance of default risk. Asset risk \u2013 In case the borrower defaults, the bank has the right to sell the hypothecated property. What if the property itself loses its value? This is a double whammy situation for the lender or the bank. The bank loses both the principal and the asset. zerodha.com/varsity 127",

Imagine a manufacturing company wants to build a new plant. The company needs about INR 800 Crores to commission this plant. How can they raise this money? There are two ways the company can raise this money \u2013 Approach a bank and seak a loan, pretty much like the apartment case we discussed Instead of a bank, the company can choose to raise a smaller amount of money from several people (investors). Say in multiples of 20Crs. The company, instead of paying interest to the bank, now pays the interest amount to multiple investors. If the company takes the 1st approach and seeks a loan from the bank, then the binding agreement is called the \u2018loan agreement\u2019. On the other hand, if the company decides to raise this money from multiple investors (multiple lenders), then the binding agreement is called \u2018 bond \u2019. Think of a bond as a promissory note from the company to its investors/lenders promising to repay the principal amount at the end of the tenure and a periodic interest amount, also called a coupon. I agree this is a rather crude and unconventional way to introduce the concept of \u2018bond\u2019 to you, but I hope you get the point.

The mutual fund companies which have the capital subscribe to bonds issued by the companies which have a capital requirement. With this background, let\u2019s start discussing the different categories of debt funds. 11.2 \u2013 The liquid fund The liquid fund is perhaps the most popular debt fund within the debt fund universe. A liquid fund makes investments in debt products which have a maximum maturity of up to 91 days. In simple words, the liquid fund invests in debt obligations, wherein the borrower promises to repay the borrowed money (principal) within 91 days (maturity) of such borrowing. Here is a typical example \u2013 Power Finance Corporation \ue081PFC\ue082 of India needs 150 Crs to fund its working capital requirement. They agree to repay the borrowed amount to the lender within 50 days. PFC agrees to pay 8.5% interest (also referred to as the coupon) against this borrowing. HDFC AMC has 150Cr to invest; they see this as an excellent opportunity to earn 8.5% interest; hence they give the funds to PFC. The deal is done. After 50 days, PFC repays 150Cr to HDFC AMC along with 8.5% interest. zerodha.com/varsity 130",

    "text": "131 Note, when any interest or coupon rate is quoted, it is quoted on an annual basis. So this is 8.5% for the 365 days. For 50 days, interest on a pro-rata basis is \u2013 = \ue08150 * 8.5%\ue082/365 = 1.164% So HDFC AMC will get back 150 Cr + 1.746Cr back from PFC. I suppose this is a relatively simple deal to understand. Like I mentioned earlier, a liquid fund by regulation can invest in debt which has a maximum maturity of 91 days. When a corporate entity borrows for such short term basis, they do so by issuing something called as a \u2018 commercial paper \u2019 or Cps. In the arbitrary PFC example I used, PFC is deemed to have issued a 50 day CP, which was subscribed by HDFC AMC. The Government too borrows on a short term basis to fund its short term financial needs. However, when the Government borrows, it does not issue a CP but instead issues a treasury bill . The Government has three variants of t-bills \u2013 1. 91-day T\ue088Bills, the maturity of 91 days 2. 182-day T\ue088Bill, the maturity of 182 days 3. 365 day T-bills, the maturity of 365 days You can read more about the treasury bills or the T\ue088Bills here. Now, place yourself as a lender, someone with surplus capital. You are looking for an opportunity to invest 100 Crs. There are two possible borrowers, both wanting 100Crs each \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 131",

This is a no brainer; you\u2019d give to the Govt because you know that with the Government, there is no credit risk. The Govt will repay, but the same cannot be said about the sugar manufacturer. Does this mean that the sugar manufacturer will never get the required funds? Yes, as long as the sugar manufacturer offers a coupon equivalent to the Govt, it will be hard for them to source the fund. The lender will lend if he is compensated for credit risk; hence the coupon has to be higher than the equivalent T-bill. So in this case, the sugar manufacturer should offer say 7 or 8%. Let\u2019s extend this thought. Assume there are two sugar manufacturing companies \u2013 Company A with an impeccable track record. It is in business for 25 years, profitable, and steady cash flows. Company B, five years of operations, breaking even, backed by young entrepreneurs. Both need 100 Crs. Both offer 8%, you have the money, whom would you lend? Company A, of course, because company A has a better financial history, hence lesser probability of default. Does that mean, Company B will never get the funds? Of course, they will, as long as they compensate the lender for the additional credit risk. Hence company B has to offer something like 10 of 11%. zerodha.com/varsity 132",

The higher, the better, which also means companies with higher credit rating can borrow money by offering lower coupons. In its portfolio, the liquid fund contains several CPs and T bills, while T bills are relatively safer, CPs aren\u2019t. This leads me to the most critical point about liquid funds. 11.3 \u2013 Why liquid fund? People invest in liquid funds to park cash, which they intend to use sometime soon. By \u2018sometime soon\u2019, I mean within a year or at the most within a year and a half. The purpose of this investment is to protect the capital, use it in its entirety for the purpose planned. So think about the liquid fund as a parking space for your excess funds. Question is \u2013 why to invest in a liquid fund and why not let it be in a bank\u2019s savings account. Well, people opt to invest in a liquid fund because the liquid fund offers a slightly higher return compared to the bank\u2019s savings account. The problem, however, is the fact that the liquid fund is often pitched as a better than a savings account \ue081SA\ue082 or the fixed deposit \ue081FD\ue082\u2019. This is not true at all. A liquid fund may offer higher than SA/FD account, but also comes with a certain amount of risk. zerodha.com/varsity 133",

All gains were wiped off, and in fact, the investors took a hit on their investment capital. It took almost a year for the fund to recover back to its previous levels. The reason for this fall was that Taurus had nearly 2000Cr of CPs issued by Ballarpur Industries.

But never in my wildest dreams could I imagine the markets getting trashed owing to a virus of an unknown origin. I guess with COVID 19, we have seen it all. At least, I hope so :).

    "text": "139 In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of a bond or a debt structure and discussed the first debt mutual fund, i.e. the liquid fund. Do recall; the liquid fund is not risk-free as most people assume, it is susceptible to both default and credit rating risk. The Taurus MF and Ballarpur example highlighted this credit risk in liquid funds. Both these risk types are significantly reduced (not eliminated) in an overnight debt fund. Remember, a liquid fund invests in papers maturing up to 91 days, this typically includes both the corporate commercial papers and the Govt\u2019s treasury bills. An overnight fund, on the other hand, invests in securities which have one-day maturity. Think of this as lending money to someone for one day only. So at the start of the day, the Fund manager of an overnight Fund lends to \u2018someone\u2019 which is recovered back in 24 hours. This is precisely what happens in an \u2018overnight debt mutual fund\u2019. Given the fact that the overnight fund invests (or lends) to 1-day debt obligation, the chance of a change in credit rating risk is low. The default risk still exists, although it is small. The next obvious question is \u2013 who are these overnight fund lending to? Well, the overnight loan happens to an RBI regulated money market instrument called \u2018Tri party Repo\u2019 or the \u2018TREPS\u2019. I\u2019ll not get into the details of what a TREP is and its purpose, I think that will stray us from the main focus of this chapter.

Have a look at the portfolio of the UTI\u2019s overnight fund \u2013 Again, 100% of the fund invests in TREP only. This leads us to an important conclusion \u2013 as every overnight fund invests in TREP instrument, there is no difference between the overnight fund A and overnight Fund B. They all tend to put up the same performance. The only difference is because of the difference in the expense ratio. zerodha.com/varsity 140",

    "text": "141 Of course, we have not discussed the expense ratio, yet in this module, we will in the coming chapter. So who would want to invest in an overnight fund? Well, this is an ideal fund for anyone looking at parking funds for a short term duration. By short term, I mean for less than three months. Remember, if you want to park funds for more than three months or 90 days, you are better off looking at a liquid fund. It is futile to look at the return aspect of an overnight fund. It does not make sense, because you don\u2019t invest in an overnight fund to chase \u2018returns\u2019, you do for the sake of convenience. However, if you are interested, as of today, overnight funds yield around 4\ue0885% annualized. So you can do the math on a pro-rata basis. 12.2 \u2013 Ultra-short duration Fund Next up is the ultra short term debt mutual fund. Things in the debt mutual fund start getting interesting from now. Think of yourself as a debt mutual fund manager. Your job as a fund manager is to find investments opportunities in the debt market. You can do so by investing the scheme\u2019s corpus in new bond/CP issues, or you can choose to buy these bonds from the secondary bond market. Think of this as buying a stock at the IPO or buying it post the IPO from the stock exchanges. Now, the moment you buy it from the zerodha.com/varsity 141",

    "text": "142 secondary market, the price of the bond will (may) differ from the first issue price. Why would the price vary? Well, for a host of reasons including the demand and supply dynamics of the bond. Each time a bond is purchased, the bond manager expects a periodic coupon (interest) payment during the tenure of the bond and at the end of the tenure, the principal to be repaid. Let us hold on to this thought for a moment. We will get back to this thread in a bit. Think of another case. Your best friend needs Rs.10,000/-. He approaches you for it and promises to repay within a year. You decide to give him this money, interest-free. Now, how long does it take for you to recover back your money? The time taken to get back your money is a year. It was easy to evaluate the time taken because there is no other cash flow in the form of interest repayment. On the other hand, if there was an additional cash flow in terms of a coupon payment, paid every three months, then what do you think would be the time taken to recover the money? While pinpointing to the exact number can be a bit tricky, intuition says that the time taken to recover the money is little lower than a full year, because there is cash flow. Do note; you can do some math and get the exact time to recover the money, but let\u2019s not get there. zerodha.com/varsity 142",

The specifications are as follows \u2013 Face value = Rs.1000 Coupon = 8% Coupon payment frequency = Semi-annual Maturity = 3 years Question \u2013 How long will the fund manager A take to recover the money invested in this bond? Answer \u2013 Intuition says that it could be a little lesser than three years. Fund manager B buys the same bond from the secondary market. Now, we know that the bond prices fluctuate in the market. Assume the fund manager B pays Rs.1020 for the same bond. Question \u2013 How long will the fund manager take to recover the money invested in this bond? Answer \u2013 Intuition says Fund manager B will take slightly higher time to recover the price paid for the bond when compared to fund manager A.

I\u2019m trying to make two points here \u2013 Bond price fluctuates Based on the price paid, the time to recover the invested amount varies. There is an exact science to estimate the time to recover, that is an integral part of the bond math. The metric, \u2018time to recover\u2019, is called \u2018 Macaulay\u2019s Duration of a Bond \u2019. Why is \u2018Macaulay Duration\u2019 essential and why are we discussing that? Well, have a look at how SEBI defines the characteristics of an ultra-short duration fund \u2013 According to this definition, an Ultra Short duration fund can invest in short maturity bills and CPs, which has a maturity between 3 month and six months \ue08190 to 180 days). zerodha.com/varsity 144",

What this means is that the fund can buy CPs with a maturity of fewer than 90 days or maybe more than 180 days, they can even invest in TREPS, but at an overall portfolio level, the fund has to ensure that the Macaulay duration of the entire portfolio falls within 3 to 6 months. To give you a perspective, have a look at the portfolio of DSP\u2019s Ultra-short duration fund \u2013 The bulk of the ultra-short duration fund is invested in money market instruments; the maturity ranges anywhere between 1 day to 365 days. Mostly these are CPs belonging to various corporate entities, here is a snapshot of their money market portfolio \u2013 They also hold NCDs and Bonds \ue081NCDs and bonds are the same), which have a maturity of at least a year \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 145",

There is another interesting point to note here \u2013 while the ratings of CPs kind of vary for the money market instruments, they are all triple-A for Bonds and NCDs. Triple AAA ratings imply that the probability of default is lower. As the maturity of the bond increases, the bond manager is more worried about possible default in the bond. Hence, they tend to stick AAA rate bonds. However, this leads us to a critical point concerning ultra-short duration funds \u2013 they are not risk-free. These funds too, have the risk of credit default and rating downgrade. Given this, who should invest in an ultra-short duration fund? I think that this is a good fund for anyone looking to park money for 1\ue0882 years, plus they are ok to take a wee bit of risk on the parked capital.

Franklin India had invested in Vodafone India Limited \ue081VIL\ue082\u2019s debt papers across six different debt schemes, including its Ultra short-duration bond fund. In Oct 2019, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgement in favour of the Dept of Telecom (Dot), in a case against DoT and the telecom operators.

Now, what do you think happens when you 4.2% of your portfolio is rendered useless? Obviously, the NAV of the fund falls. Check this \u2013 In my view, Franklin may take at least a year or year and a half to get back to the previous NAV levels.

However, while we cruise along, there are few bond relationships that you need to know \u2013 The yield of a bond and the price of the bond are inversely proportional.

While we are at it, let me introduce another term \u2013 \u2018 Modified Duration\u2019, of the bond. The modified duration (measured in years) of a bond is essentially the sensitivity of the bond\u2019s price to the change in interest rate. So if a bond has a modified duration of 3.2 years, then \u2013 A 1% increase in interest rate decreases the bond\u2019s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% increase in the interest rate, lower the bond\u2019s price by 4.8% A 1% decrease in interest rate increases the bond\u2019s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% decrease in bond price, increases the bond\u2019s price by 4.8% We can generalize this \u2013 Higher duration funds have a higher sensitivity to interest rate changes. So a 1% change in interest rate reduced the price of a longer duration fund in a greater magnitude compared to a low duration fund and vice versa. In the context of a mutual debt fund, the modified duration is at an aggregate portfolio level. In the example above, say for a 1.5% increase in the interest rate, the debt fund\u2019s NAV is likely to decrease by 4.8%. I hope you get the dri\u0000. As a debt mutual fund investor, you are in the right spot if you are aware of the few points we have discussed so far.

Anyway, we will get back to the good old debt mutual funds. In this chapter, we will continue our discussion and take a few more debt (sub) categories. We will start the conversation with the low duration, money market, and short-duration funds. 13.2 \u2013 Low duration and Money Market We looked at the ultra-short duration bond fund in the previous chapter. The defining criterion for the ultra-short duration fund was the Macaulay duration of the portfolio. As per SEBI\u2019s classification, at the aggregate portfolio level, the Macaulay duration of the ultra short term duration fund has to vary between three to six months. Next up is the low duration fund. The low duration fund is just like the ultra-short duration, only that the low duration fund, the Macaulay duration at the aggregate portfolio level varies between six to twelve months. The credit risk of the low duration fund is similar to the ultra-short duration fund. Hence it is imperative for the investors to glance through the asset quality (paper quality) of the fund. zerodha.com/varsity 153",

However, just because the fund has only AAA papers, does not imply zero credit risk. Remember, we discussed the Vodafone case in the previous chapter. While the credit risk exists, the interest rate risk for the low duration fund is low. Have a look at the modified duration of IDFC\u2019s Low duration fund (published in the fund\u2019s factsheet) \u2013 The modified duration is 289 days.

While we are at it, which of the two low duration funds do you think is risky in terms of modified duration? IDFC\u2019s Low duration Fund with a modified duration of 0.802 or Nippon India\u2019s low duration fund with a modified duration of 0.94? Here is a task for you \u2013 why do you think Nippon India\u2019s low duration fund has a higher modified duration? Can you look into their portfolio (as of April 2020) and get your answer? If you can answer these questions with ease, then we are headed on the right track \ud83d\ude42 Lastly, who should look at investing in a low duration fund? This is best suited under situations where you want to park your money for a short duration and utilize the funds towards a specific goal at a later point. Next up is the money market fund. The money market fund is somewhat similar to the low duration fund. Here is SEBI\u2019s classification of the money market fund \u2013 As you can see, the maturity is capped to one year, similar to that of low duration fund; the only difference is in terms of the portfolio constituents. zerodha.com/varsity 156",

The money market fund, however, can invest only in money market instruments. The money market instruments usually consist \u2013 \u2018Commercial Papers\u2019 or CPs, issued by companies. CPs are unsecured \u2018Certificate of Deposits\u2019 or CDs. Banks issue CDs to entities depositing money T-Bills, issued by the Government, carries a sovereign guarantee. So just to summarize, the fund manager of a low duration fund can invest in CPs, CDs, and perhaps even in a bond with two years maturity. However, a money market fund manager can only invest in CDs and CPs. Let me ask you two question \u2013 What is the risk of investing in a money market fund? What do you think will be the modified duration of a money market fund? Will it be 1, greater than one or less than 1. Do pause here, think about it, try to answer yourself.

Of course, the company\u2019s paper enjoys a high rating, but I want you to remember the fact that these ratings can change. So yeah, credit risk exists in a money market fund. As you may have guessed, the modified duration will be under one year for a money market fund, which implies that the interest rate risk for these funds is low.

A\u0000er reading the SEBI definition, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? Well, I hope you think about it from a risk perspective. With an increase in the duration, the modified duration also increases \u2013 which means the risk associated with changes in interest rate is higher with a short duration fund (and the medium duration fund). Do note; this was not so much of a concern with the low duration and money market fund (or even the ultra-short duration fund). Of course, credit risk continues for short duration fund as well.

Unfortunately, the secondary bond market in India is not liquid enough. It is not easy for the fund managers to quickly liquidate the bonds from their portfolio. For this reason, most of the bonds held to maturity. Of course, the AMC plans to have enough cash to meet daily redemptions, they do this in several ways, including a technique called laddering, wherein they have a blend of papers maturing in different timelines. The liquidity arrangements work when business functions as usual. But as we clearly understand now, things go helter-skelter when tables turn. None of the AMCs would be (at least up until now) prepared for such a steep surge in redemption. Hence to ease the situation, Franklin has decided to close down the schemes completely and lockdown the funds entirely, which implies that if you are an investor in these funds, then you cannot place a redemption request. Please note, the AMC is not winding down the scheme because of the credit or interest rate risk. Folks at Franklin are outstanding in the debt fund game, and they have vast experience in this segment, but unfortunately, they are now threading on a different territory. Therefore, dear readers, when investing in debt funds, along with the credit and interest rate risk, factor in a new risk \u2013 liquidity risk. zerodha.com/varsity 164",

Thanks to this episode, as investors, we now very clearly know that investing in debt fund should not be based on useless parameters such as the past returns or the current fund ranking. The market has taught us one two many times that this approach to fund selection is a pointless affair. The evaluation must be based on risk metrics. Unless the investor develops a sense of all the risk involved while investing in a debt fund, he or she should not even venture into the debt fund arena. The same holds for equity funds as well. However, thanks to the tagline \u2018Mutual funds are subjected to market risk\u2019, investors somehow perceive market risk as a risk associated (only) with equity funds. Still, at least they are aware of the fact that equity funds are risky. Unfortunately, the same set of people assume that the debt funds do not carry any risk. If you have read the previous chapters, you know that debt funds are risky too, and you are even familiar with the risk types associated with debt funds, i.e. default risk, credit risk, and the interest rate risk. The recent Franklin episode formally introduced us to another dormant risk factor called the \u2018Liquidity Risk\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 166",

Liquidity risk, from the debt fund perspective, can mean two things \u2013 \u25cf The lack of liquidity in the underlying market the debt funds invests in, i.e. the Indian bond markets. \u25cf The lack of availability of funds with the AMCs to service investor\u2019s redemption Both these are tightly related though. The lack of liquidity in the bond market implies that the AMCs cannot quickly liquidate the papers they hold in the bond market, which means to say that they are obligated to keep the paper to maturity, which further implies that the money is kind of \u2018locked-in\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 167",

    "text": "168 Now the primary job of an AMC is to collect money from an investor, invest that money on their behalf, generate returns for the investors, and return the funds when the investor redeems the units. To honour the investor\u2019s redemption, the AMC must hold enough cash across each of the schemes. If the AMC does not have enough funds, then they cannot service the redemption requests that come in, especially in case the redemption requests come in large numbers. Think about it for a second \u2013 on the one hand; the AMC has invested in debt papers which it cannot sell as and when they wish (lack of liquidity in bonds market) and on the other hand, it has to maintain a cash pile to service redemptions. In the event redemption comes in large numbers, the lack of cash causes a liquidity crisis. Franklin India faced this same situation. One a day to day basis, AMCs maintain enough cash to service redemptions, a\u0000er all, redemptions are a regular affair for an AMCs. However, if there is a surge in redemption, then the AMC will need extra cash to service the redemption. Question is where they will get this money? You guessed it right, they borrow. Under SEBI\u2019s guidelines, an AMC can borrow up to 20% of its net asset under management (AUM). You can read the detailed directions here \u2013 Here is the extract on AMC\u2019s borrowing limits \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 168",

How do we get to know if the AMC is borrowing? Well, one needs to look at the monthly portfolio declaration that the AMC makes. If the cash component is positive, that means to say that the AMC is not borrowing funds, if it is negative, then that shows the presence of debt.

Franklin folded this particular fund along with five others on 23rd April 2020. So there was some warning on the wall. There are a couple of things to note here \u2013 \u25cf Just because you see a negative cash value, do not jump into the conclusion that the fund is about to go bust. Develop a sense to connect the dots to understand what is happening. \u25cf The negative cash component can be a lagging indicator \u2013 remember the AMC\u2019s portfolio details comes out with a delay; nevertheless, this is still a good indicator of trouble. So if you are a \u2018do it yourself\u2019 investor, then do keep an eye on this every month. The onus is on you to figure the development in the market and connect these dots.

If you are someone like me, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have thought that the Banking and PSU debt Fund, as the name suggests is a fund that invests in papers from the banking and PSU sector. The banking and PSU sector is as one of the safest in India. Fair enough now let\u2019s see what SEBI has to say \u2013 Well, it looks like we were almost right \ud83d\ude42 The fund invests in banking and PSU debt to the extent of 80%. Pay attention to the 80% part here! The remaining 20% gets invested in any paper. Suddenly what seemed like a harmless debt fund turns out tricky. This is an 80-20 cocktail, and there is a problem with it. Think about this from a regular retail investor, when he reads the fund\u2019s title; it is only natural for him to expect the fund to be 100% Banking and PSU debt, he would not expect the fund to have papers from the private sector. If a default occurs in any of the paper from the 20% bucket, then the fund\u2019s NAV takes a hit. Who is to blame here? The investor for expecting a pure-play Banking & PSU fund, the fund manager for lousy investment, or SEBI for permitting this cocktail? zerodha.com/varsity 172",

Given this, the modified duration will be on the higher side for these funds. Here are the parameters for the IDFC\u2019s Banking & PSU Debt fund \u2013 The average duration is about 3.1 years, which is in line with any mid duration fund. The modified duration is about 2.6, which for a debt fund is on the slightly higher end of the spectrum. If the interest rate goes up, the fund will take quite a bit of time to recover from the fallen NAV. Given this, an investor looking at investing in these debt funds should have at least 3-5 years perspective while investing in the Banking & PSU Debt fund. At this point, I think it is important to remind the readers that so far in this module, we are only introducing different types of fund. We have made few passing comments on some of these categories, but we still haven\u2019t figured how and why one should invest if at all one has to.

Think of it like a hungry kid at a buffet dinner party. The plate will be loaded, with zero control on what gets packed in the plate. Similarly, a fund manager running a credit risk fund loads up the portfolio with risky papers to chase yields. Let me explain this. The objective of a credit risk fund is to take on as much credit risk as possible to ensure a higher yield to the investors. What does this mean? This means the fund will lend the investor\u2019s funds to corporates whose repayment track record or repayment capability is questionable. Why would the fund manager deliberately lend to a corporate who is unlikely to repay? He does so because the corporates in need of the fund say, \u2018give me the money, and I\u2019ll compensate you with higher interest rates\u2019. You see the point, right? Corporate with bad credit history has to entice new lender by paying a higher coupon rate. The debt papers of such corporates usually have a lower rating. When the fund manager lends to such entities, he hopes for the following \u2013 \u25cf The borrowing entity will repay and honour the interest paid regularly. \u25cf He also hopes the corporate entity improves its creditworthiness. zerodha.com/varsity 176",

Let us look at a portfolio of a Credit Risk Fund; this belongs to DSP\u2019s Credit Risk fund \u2013 The fund manager here has decided to allocate nearly 30% of its assets to just one company. You can imagine the hit on the NAV of this fund if this company were to default on its obligation. The credit ratings of the other companies are not excellent either; well, this is expected from a credit risk fund. Still, the combination of concentrated positions coupled with lousy credit ratings makes this a hazardous category to invest. zerodha.com/varsity 177",

Almost all portfolio goals of a retail investor can be achieved without GILTS in the portfolio. So do avoid investing your money in a credit risk fund. 14.4 \u2013 GILT Funds Back in the early 19th Century, when the Government would borrow money, they would do so by issuing a bond (a physical paper), on which the terms of the borrowing were written and signed. The edges of such a bond were laced in Gold, to showcase the sanctity of Government borrowing. Such bonds issued by the Government were called the \u2018Gilt-edged bonds\u2019, because of golden edges. The presence of Gold does not eliminate the credit or interest rate risk, at the end of the day, this technically is still a bond \ud83d\ude42 However, the fact that the borrower is the Government implies that there is virtually zero Credit risk, because, well, the Government cannot default on debt obligations. The legacy continues, and even today, the bonds issued by the Government is called a GILT, there is no gold lacing today, but the Sovereign Guarantee still exists. Now, as you can imagine, a mutual fund that invests predominantly in Government bonds or Gilts is called a \u2018Gilt Fund\u2019. Here is SEBI\u2019s definition of a GILT fund \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 178",

This implies 20% can go anywhere (again the cocktail problem) \u25cf Gilt with ten-year constant duration \u2013 This fund is the same as above with the added clause that the Macaulay\u2019s duration is at least ten years. By defining the duration, the entire risk profile of this fund changes. Agreed, there is no Credit risk for the investor here. We expect the Government never to default. But think about the interest rate risk in these funds, especially the constant duration one. As you can imagine the interest rate risk is quite significant in these funds, probably large enough to compensates for the absence of credit risk. I would urge you to look into the fact sheet of any GILT fund and observe the duration and modified duration to get a sense of how risky these funds are. If you ever decide to invest in these funds, then do so only with a long, really long term perspective. I\u2019m talking about 8-10 year time frame here. I really don\u2019t see a need for a GILT fund in any retail portfolio; you are better without this. zerodha.com/varsity 179",

    "text": "185 Let\u2019s start with the first item from the le\u0000. As we can see, this is a secured debt . A secured debt is a loan backed by security. The classic example is a Gold loan. In a gold loan, you pledge the gold and raise a loan against it. When you repay the loan, the pledge on gold goes away, and you get back the gold. In case you don\u2019t repay the loan, the lender is free to take your gold and make good for his loss. Given this, if you look at it from the lender\u2019s perspective, a secured debt gives the lender a higher comfort compared to unsecured debt. In the next section, you can see that this is senior debt. Every company has something called \u2018Capital Structure\u2019. The capital structure is like a leader board of sorts, which mandates the list of stakeholders who have the highest claim on the company\u2019s repayment and earning structure. The senior secured debt sits right at the top of a capital structure, while a common stock (equities) sits right at last. Between the senior debt and zerodha.com/varsity 185",

This significantly enhances the safety of capital for senior debt holders. So the moment you see secured senior debt, be assured that the credit risk associated is relatively very low. The section a\u0000er this is quite self-explanatory, talks about the date of issue. Think about this as the company\u2019s IPO date or an NFO debuting in the MF market.

Now move your attention to the details mentioned on the right \u2014 the topmost section details out a few essential parameters. Firstly, the face value, which is Rs.1000/-. The face value of a bond is essential for three reasons \u2013 1. Gives you a sense of the premium or discount the bond is trading to its face value. In the case of REC (refer to the snapshot from COIN), the current price for this bond is Rs.1115.03/-, which is at a premium to face value. 2. The coupon is paid as a percentage of the face value. The coupon for this bond is 8.01%, which means that every bond you hold gives you Rs.80.01/- as interest income until it matures. 3. Upon maturity, the redemption value depends on the bond\u2019s face value. More on this later. zerodha.com/varsity 186",

The company pays out interest annually. Some bonds pay interest semiannually, quarterly, and some even pay monthly. You can also see the maturity date, which is 24th September 2023. Now that you know these details, I\u2019d suggest you re-look at the COIN snapshot. Everything mentioned in the snapshot should be clear, except for the YTM. 15.3 \u2013 Yield to Maturity The concept of \u2018Yield to Maturity\u2019 or YTM is one of the most important concepts to understand when dealing with bonds. While the bond\u2019s coupon is essential, as an investor in bonds, you need to be more concerned about the YTM than the coupon itself. I think the concept of YTM is best understood if we look at it from transactions we are familiar with. Given this, let us build a hypothetical situation around this. Scenario 1 Your friend informs you about a fantastic commercial property, capable of giving you a 20% rental yield on the investment. Rental yield = Total rent collected in the year / Amount invested in the property. zerodha.com/varsity 187",

You ask your friend for more information. He tells that the fair price for the commercial property is 3 Crores. You do not bat an eyelid; you pay 3 Crore cash down and buy the property. From the next month, you start receiving a rent of Rs.500,000/- into your account. Twelve months pass by, and rental income is flowing smoothly. However, at the end of 12 months, you have a premonition that a virus will hit the world, people will start working from home, and therefore the commercial real estate will lose its sheen. You decide to sell the property and cash out. Assume the property market stayed flat; hence, you get to sell the property at cost, i.e. 3 Crore. The question is, how much did you make on this entire transaction? In other words, what was your Net Yield? For the sake of simplicity, forget about taxes and charges. This is a straightforward calculation \u2013 Buy Price = 3 Crore Sell Price = 3 Crore P&L on Property = 0 \u2014\u2014\u2014- (1) Rental per month = Rs.500,000/- zerodha.com/varsity 188",

I suppose you are familiar with most of the information present on this screen, except for the accrued interest bit. The concept of accrued interest is straightforward to understand. We know the REC bond pays a coupon of 8.01% on Rs.1000/- face value. The Rupee value of the coupon is Rs.80.01/-. The coupon of Rs.80.01/- gets paid once a year or once in 365 days. We know the date of payment is the 1st December every year. The last coupon was paid on 1st December 2019, and the next coupon will be paid on 1st December 2020.

Just to recap, a mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle that takes your money, invests and manages it on your behalf. What distinguishes one fund from another is the management part. There are 100s of strategies that AMCs employ but broadly speaking, you can categorize them as: \u25cf Active \u25cf Passive In an active mutual fund, the fund manager tries to beat a benchmark or deliver alpha . In simple terms, alpha is the excess return above a benchmark. Before we go further, it\u2019s important to understand what a benchmark is and why do you need a benchmark. A benchmark serves as a point of reference for measuring performance because you cannot look at the performance of a mutual fund in isolation. Every mutual fund benchmarks itself to an index like the Ni\u0000y 100, Ni\u0000y Midcap 150, Ni\u0000y Smallcap 100, etc depending on the category it operates in. Benchmarks also give you an idea of the returns you would\u2019ve made if you had done nothing and just bought the index. Now, the job of the active manager is to deliver returns over and above the benchmark. He does this by actively picking stocks or based on various strategies and by deviating from the benchmark to various degrees. For zerodha.com/varsity 197",

On the other end of the spectrum, there\u2019s growth investing where a manager invests in companies, as the name implies that is growing at a faster rate than their peers/industry and also invest most of the earnings back in the business to fuel the growth. Similarly, there are hundreds and thousands of approaches and strategies used by managers, which is outside the scope of this chapter, but I hope you got the idea. The job of an active manager is to beat the benchmark. A passive fund or an index fund, on the other hand, simply tracks the performance of a benchmark as closely as possible. It does not try to outperform or underperform the benchmark, but just match the returns before costs (expense ratio). Mutual funds have costs, so the return of an index fund, broadly speaking, will be the benchmark returns minus costs. So, when you invest in a Ni\u0000y 50 index fund, all you are getting is Ni\u0000y 50 returns. If Ni\u0000y 50 returns 10% this year, your return will be 10% minus the expense ratio. It\u2019s as simple as that. zerodha.com/varsity 198",

The story of how the first index fund came to be is quite fascinating. John C. Bogle, also known as Jack Bogle, the founder Vanguard, launched the first index fund in 1976. The fund was called the First Index Investment and tracked the S&P 500 Index. The fund was later renamed as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. For context, the S&P 500 consists of the 500 biggest US companies, and the index is a market capitalization-weighted. Meaning, the total free float outstanding shares of a company are multiplied by its price zerodha.com/varsity 199",

The crazy thing about the first index fund is that the launch was an abject failure. Vanguard led by Jack Bogle was hoping to raise $150 million during the underwriting process but managed to raise just $11.3 million. They didn\u2019t even have enough money to buy all the shares in the index. What they ended up doing is they sampled the index, they just bought enough stocks across sectors to broadly resemble an index, and it worked out well in the end. If Jack Bogle had given up, we probably would have had to wait longer for an index fund and history would have been much different. Even though it was launched in 1976, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund didn\u2019t reach the $1 billion mark until 1990. As of writing this chapter, however, the fund has $500 billion in assets and is the largest mutual fund on the planet. This fund alone is bigger than the entire Indian mutual fund industry, which has about $350 billion in assets. As for Vanguard, it is the second-largest AMC in the world with over $6 trillion in assets, next only to Blackrock, which has close to $7 trillion in assets. India IDBI Principal was the first AMC to launch an index mutual fund tracking Ni\u0000y in India. The scheme later became the Principal Ni\u0000y 100 Equal-Weight fund. Benchmark AMC was the first to launch Ni\u0000ybees \u2013 an index exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the Ni\u0000y 50. Benchmark was later acquired by Goldman Sachs India which was acquired by Reliance mutual fund which was acquired by Nippon. zerodha.com/varsity 200",

Before you start thinking when did index funds become so popular in India, they aren\u2019t \ud83d\ude42 Pretty much all of the money in this ETF is from The Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). It started investing in equities since 2015 and Ni\u0000y, and Sensex ETFs were the chosen routes. The AUM if Index mutual funds is a better proxy of the popularity of these funds and as of April 2020, they just had Rs 8,800 crores in AUM. This is nothing compared to the Rs 119,861 crores in active large-cap mutual funds, for example. 16.3 Definition of an index fund The active vs passive debate is one of the longest-running, loudest, and one the most controversial debates in finance, I\u2019ll get to that later. But even when it comes to the definition of an index fund, there are widely different thoughts. Today, any fund that tracks an index is called an index fund. You can technically create an index of companies whose name starts with the letter G and then launch a fund tracking that index. But the very first index fund was tracked the S&P 500 which is a market capitalization-weighted index. But according to the hardcore finance guys and academics, a true index fund is one that tracks a broad cap-weighted index like the Ni\u0000y 50, S&P 500 etc. zerodha.com/varsity 201",

Outperformance is always better than just benchmark returns, right? Let\u2019s unwrap this. There are a bunch of complicated ways this can be answered, but here\u2019s the gist. If you think about it, markets are a zero-sum game, meaning for every person making money, somebody has to lose money. Here\u2019s an illustration to explain that: This means that all active managers collectively cannot beat the market. The reason is cost, and they are the biggest drag on the performance. Now forget that you read the previous paragraph for a minute and let\u2019s look at costs. An active mutual fund seeks to outperform any index, which means it needs the resources to do so. This involves hiring a bunch of analysts, getting the best Chief Investment Officer(s), the best research, the best tools \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 202",

Let\u2019s compare the expense ratios of active large-cap mutual funds and index mutual funds. Moneycontrol shows the category average expense ratios, which allows you to quickly get a sense. The category average expense ratio of active mutual large-cap mutual funds (direct plans) is 1.28% The category average for index funds, on the other hand, is 0.31%. Note: the average expense ratios will be far higher for regular plans of mutual funds. That\u2019s almost a 1% difference. Though this might seem small, costs compound over a long period and significantly eat into your returns. If you are investing on Coin, you\u2019d have already realized this and made the smart choice. But just to reiterate, you can use the savings calculator on Coin to calculate the impact of costs. Here\u2019s the difference between paying .6% and 1.6% on a Rs 10,000 SIP over 20 years. That tiny 1% difference will cost you Rs 12.8 lakhs. zerodha.com/varsity 203",

Right out of the gate, the active fund is at a disadvantage and has to generate 1.4% just to keep up with the benchmark, and I am not even talking about outperforming the benchmark. Index funds, on the other hand, are extremely cheap. The SBI Ni\u0000y ETF charges 0.07% for comparison.

This report looks at the performance of active funds versus a standardized benchmark period for 1,3,5,10 periods. Here\u2019s how the Indian active mutual funds have fared as of the end of 2019. On 5 years, 82% of active large-cap funds have underperformed the S&P BSE 100 index, which consists of the 100 largest Indian companies by market cap. Although the performance of mid and small-caps looks promising, things seem to be changing. With the recategorization exercise, SEBI has clearly defined the universe of stocks fund managers can invest in which will make outperformance harder. Up until last year, we didn\u2019t have mid-cap index mutual funds, we had ETFs, but they were illiquid. Several AMCs have started launching them over the past year or so. As for small-caps, active or passive, I don\u2019t think investors should invest in these funds at all. They seem to fall as fast as they go up, which makes it frustrating for investors to hold on to. That gut-wrenching volatility also increasing the chances of investors buying high and selling low. 16.6 Bottomline Based on the numbers at any given point, your chances of picking a consistently performing active fund is worse than 50:50. In the case of large-caps, it\u2019s consistently worse. And it\u2019s going to get worse as the Indian capital markets deepen. Let\u2019s take the case of large-caps, and there are 40 AMCs and 40 large-cap funds.

And there\u2019s also the issue of funds just hugging benchmarks which is quite common \u2013 this is also referred to as closet indexing. Most funds don\u2019t deviate significantly from the benchmarks, and a\u0000er expenses, they are guaranteed to underperform the index. There\u2019s another way of looking at this. Famed researcher Michael Mauboussin, in this paper, termed this the paradox of skill: \u201cIn cases where two or more players have the same level of skill\u2014whether that skill is high or low doesn\u2019t matter\u2014the skills of the players offset one another and luck becomes the primary determinant of the outcome. \u201cPlayers\u201d can be athletes, investors, or business executives. In many competitive realms, including investing, the skills of the participants have improved on an absolute basis but have shrunk on a relative basis. Today\u2019s investor has vastly more resources and training than his or her predecessor from years past. The problem is that investors, broadly speaking, have gotten much better which means that the difference between the skill of the best and the average participant isn\u2019t as great as it used to be\u201d 16.7 Fixed income (Debt) So far, when I say an index fund, I\u2019ve meant equity index funds. Globally in the last 5-10 years index funds including debt index funds, have experienced phenomenal growth. Bond ETFs recently crossed the $1 trillion mark in the US.

Except for G-Secs and the best AAA-rated bonds, most other bonds trade sparingly. And unlike equities which trade on the exchanges and there\u2019s transparent price discovery, most of the trading activity in bonds happens over the counter (OTC) or off-market. It\u2019s the same even in the US, where the debt market is bigger than the equity market. This, among many other things, makes indexing debt very hard, but maybe as the markets evolve, things should change. There are companies like Tradeweb trying to bring electronic trading to the bond markets. 16.8 Active or passive (Conclusion) A\u0000er reading all this, you might be wondering if you should choose active or index funds. It\u2019s not active or passive but active and passive. You can mix both in your portfolio and have allocation based on your risk tolerance. But always pick a fund that has a long track record and sticks it\u2019s stated mandate. Before the SEBI scheme recategorization exercise, funds didn\u2019t have any restrictions on how they could invest.

While I was all set to do that, I just remembered we hadn\u2019t discussed the \u2018Arbitrage Funds\u2019, which for some reason has all the market attention these days. So I\u2019ll keep this chapter short, consider the Arbitrage fund and move ahead. Before we understand the \u2018Arbitrage Fund\u2019, we need to understand what \u2018Arbitrage\u2019 means. Of course, if you are a regular Varsity reader, then this is something you guys are familiar. We have discussed arbitrage on a couple of occasions, in particular, we have looked at arbitrage in the form of calendar spreads, pair trading, and put-call parity. For others who are not familiar with \u2018Arbitrage\u2019, here is a quick note. All of us, at some point in life, would have carried out an arbitrage transaction. For example, when I was in my 1st-year college, I\u2019d pay my cousin in Singapore to buy me Rock n Roll audio cassettes from Rs.100/- per tape and sell the same here in Bangalore for Rs.150/-. People here would happily buy the tape at Rs.150/- because there was no other source for them to buy these tapes. zerodha.com/varsity 209",

In an arbitrage transaction, you buy an asset (like the audiotape) from one market (Singapore) where the asset is selling cheap (Rs.100/-) and sell the same asset (the audiotape) in another market (Bangalore) for a higher price (150). The arbitrageur (i.e. me in this example), makes a risk free profit (Rs.50/- in this case). If you think about this, arbitrage is beautiful, right? If the above were to hold, all I had to do in life was buy tapes from Singapore and sell the same in Bangalore. I do this in large quantities, and I\u2019d be sitting on a massive pile of cash. But if only life was that easy \ud83d\ude42 The assumption here is that there are continuous supply and demand in both markets.

So the point is, unlike the popular notion, arbitrage is not risk-free. What we discussed is an example of the supply-demand risk associated with the arbitrage opportunity. But it is not just that. Imagine another scenario, where a friend of mine figures my little trick, and he does the same, i.e. buy tapes from Singapore at Rs.100/- but sells the same at a slightly lower rate at say Rs.140/- to ensure he beats me at my own game. What do you think would happen next? A price war would break, I\u2019d offer the same at say 135, he would then reduce to 125 so on as so forth till all the margins evaporate. Point being, arbitrage opportunity or arbitrage profits shrink when more people try to exploit the same opportunity. Now, think about the stock markets. Take a look at the snapshot below \u2013 What you see here is the quote for Kirloskar Industries, on NSE it is trading at 562.4 per share, and on BSE the same company is trading at 546.40 per share.

A mutual fund scheme that manages money by mostly chasing such arbitrage opportunities in the market is called \u2018The Arbitrage Fund\u2019. 17.2 \u2013 The Arbitrage Fund While we looked at one type of arbitrage opportunity in the previous section, in reality, there are many types of arbitrage opportunities in the market. For instance, one of the most attractive arbitrage opportunity that the mutual fund looks for is the \u2018Spot-Future\u2019 arbitrage, wherein the futures trade at a price which is significantly away from its fair value when compared to its underlying price. In other words, at any given point, the fund is continuously long or short on the stock in either the equity or futures market. Did the above line confuse you?

The difference between cash and futures is \u2013 5,735.6 \u2013 5,714.4 = 21.2 The difference between cash and futures is called the spread or the basis. One can capture the spread by setting up an arbitrage. Remember the thumb rule in arbitrage is to buy the asset in the cheaper market and sell the same asset in the expensive market. Hence, all one has to do here is \u2013 Buy Maruti @ 5714.4 in the cash market Sell Maruti Futures (Exping in June)@ 5735.6 It is important to ensure the above transaction is simultaneously executed. Once you do, you\u2019ve locked in the spread, and it no longer matters where Maruti trades because the spread of 21.6 is guaranteed. The key here is the fact that on the expiry day, Maruti in cash and Futures will trade at a single price (unlike today). The phenomenon is called \u2018Cash-Futures Convergence\u2019.

Hence it is prudent to have a long term investment horizon while investing in an arbitrage fund. I hope I\u2019ve not scared you away from investing in an Arbitrage fund \ud83d\ude42 The good part of an arbitrage fund is that it behaves as a debt fund but gets taxed as an equity fund. We will have a chapter dedicated to mutual fund taxation, till then, here is how taxation works (very broadly) \u2013 \u25cf Gains from Equity funds sold within 12 months are treated as short term capital gain, attracts a 15% tax. \u25cf Gains from Equity funds sold a\u0000er 12 months are treated as long term capital gain, attracts a 10% tax, a\u0000er an exemption of Rs.1,00,000/- \u25cf Gain from debt funds held for less than 36 months is treated as short term capital gains, attracts a tax as per the investor\u2019s income tax slab. \u25cf Gain from debt funds held for more than 36 months is treated as long term capital gains, attracts a 20% tax post indexation. zerodha.com/varsity 218",

    "text": "219 Given the tax treatment, in my opinion, if you are prepared to take some risk, then use the Arbitrage fund as a proxy for say low duration or a short duration fund. The risk and return profile are similar for these funds. Hence, in my opinion, the real arbitrage in an arbitrage fund is the tax arbitrage, i.e. it behaves like a debt fund and gets taxed as an equity fund. Lastly, when you look for an arbitrage fund, it is essential to look at the debt component of the portfolio. Ensure the fund does not have concentrated debt positions and also ensure the there are no papers which are below investible grade. Also, it is crucial to confirm that the arbitrage fund is not holding any unhedged equity position because this defeats the purpose of an arbitrage fund. Next up is Mutual fund metrics. Stay tuned. Key takeaways from this chapter 1. Arbitrage funds are hedged position 2. SEBI mandates AMCs to invest a minimum of 65% in arbitrage strategies 3. Mutual funds usually spend up to 35% in debt 4. Arbitrage funds can be volatile 5. One can consider Arbitrage funds as a proxy for low/short duration funds zerodha.com/varsity 219",

While we have not covered the entire gamut of funds, I think we have covered the most important funds across both equity and debt. Probably I must have discussed the Balanced fund as well, not sure why (and how) I missed that. But I also believe we have laid down a foundation for structured thinking about funds and their mandates. So I\u2019d request you to please look upon few balanced fund factsheets, read it along with the SEBI\u2019s classification and you will understand how the balanced fund works. Otherwise, you can always drop your queries here, and I\u2019ll be more than happy to answer them for you. Anyway, I think we are now one step closer to understand how one can build a mutual fund portfolio for different financial goals. Before we get into the building MF portfolios, we must spend time to understand few mutual fund metrics that help us understand mutual funds better and the ways to differentiate good funds from the not so good funds. zerodha.com/varsity 220",

Over the next few chapters, we will understand the following metrics that are usually published by the AMCs for the different schemes that they run \u2013 1. Returns \u2013 Absolute, CAGR, XIRR 2. Rolling Returns 3. Expense Ratio 4. Benchmarking 5. Exit load 6. Portfolio turnover ratio 7. Standard Deviation 8. Beta 9.

Most investors apply the standard return measurement technique across all types of investment. Doing so leads to wrong return zerodha.com/varsity 221",

We should start our discussion with the basic concept of return measurement. For the sake of this discussion, I\u2019ll assume that you are familiar with the systematic investment plan or the SIP. I guess the AMCs and the regulators have managed to do a phenomenal job at conveying the concept of SIP to every taxpayer in the country (well, all most all). Hence, I will not spend time to discuss what a SIP is and its massive advantage for an investor. If you are not familiar with what a SIP is, I will request you to spend a little time on the internet; there are tons of great articles with SIP calculators to help you understand what a SIP is and how to set up one. zerodha.com/varsity 222",

    "text": "223 However, for the sake of the completeness of this discussion, let me highlight two popular investments techniques \u2013 Lumpsum investments \u2013 In a lumpsum investment, an investor decides to invest a random amount (based on cash available) at one time. Example \u2013 I get a yearly bonus of Rs.1,00,000/-, of which I decide to invest Rs.75,000/- in a mutual fund. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) \u2013 SIP investments requires you to invest a fixed amount of money on a fixed monthly date in a designated fund. The investment can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, or even once in 6 months. For example, my very first SIP was set to invest Rs.2,500/- on 5th of every month in Sundaram Midcap fund. There is no end date to this and can go on for as long as possible. The way one measures the return for these two investments is very different. Most investors take the starting and ending value of their investment and figure out what the return is. While this is one way to measure returns, this is not the only way. While measuring return, you need to factor time into consideration. For example, if I tell you that I made an 80% return on a certain investment, what would your first reaction be? I guess you\u2019d say its amazing. Now, what if said that I made 80% over 15 years? Does it look attractive? I don\u2019t think so, right? Time adds a very important dimension while we measure the return. Hence it is always important to consider time. Given the two types of investment, let us separate these investments into different time buckets \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 223",

    "text": "224 The table above helps us understand the different types of investment and the respective type of return we should calculate. For example, we should calculate the absolute return for a lumpsum investment which is less than one year. Likewise, we should look at the XIRR return for a SIP which is older than a year. Although for you as a mutual fund investor, you don\u2019t really have to learn how to calculate the absolute return, CAGR or XIRR because there are tons of free return calculators available online. However, I think it will just make you a prudent investor if you take a little time to figure out how this can be done. Let\u2019s start with the absolute return. Remember Absolute Return matters only if the investment is less than a year. It could be a lump sum or a SIP, but as long as the investment is less than a year, use absolute return. The calculation is straight forward. Here is an example \u2013 On Jan 1st 2020, I invest Rs.25,000 in a Mutual Fund. On July 7th, the value of this fund is Rs.30,000/-. What is the return generated? You should recognise that this is a lump sum invested and is under a year. The absolute return can be calculated as \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 224",

A\u0000er six months, the value of the investment is Rs.35,000/-. What is the return experience here? We know that this is a case of SIP investments. Monthly investment \u2013 Rs.5,000/- Number of months \u2013 6 (less than one year) Total investment value = 5000 * 6 = Rs.30,000/- Current value of investment = Rs.35,000/- We need to apply the absolute value calculation here \u2013 =35,000/30,000 -1 =17% For SIPs less than one year, we can indeed calculate XIRR, but from my experience, the most investor will not comprehend this number well as it is non-intuitive. Let us revisit the SIP for less than one year a little later to understand why this may not be the best choice. For now, all you need to know if that if an investment (lumpsum or SIP) is less than a year, then you have to use absolute returns. zerodha.com/varsity 225",

    "text": "226 Next up is the CAGR. CAGR or the Compounded Annual Growth Rate measures the \u2018rate at which the investment is growing\u2019. Let us take a quick example and deep dive into this \u2013 I invest Rs.25,000/- on 1st of July 2017 in a certain Mutual Fund. Three years later, the investment has grown to Rs.40,000/-. What is the return on this investment? I\u2019ve kept the question in bold to draw your attention to the question itself. We will revisit that in a bit. You should identify that this is a lumpsum investment. Since the period is more than one year, we need to use the CAGR to calculate the return. The formula to calculate the CAGR is straight forward \u2013 [Ending Value / Starting Value ]^(1/n) \u2013 1 Where n is time in years. Let us apply this formula \u2013 = [40,000/25,000]^(1/3)-1 = 16.96% The investment made in this fund has grown at a rate of 16.96% on year on year basis. Recognise that this is the growth rate of the investment. The most common confusion for the investor is this \u2013 I invest 25,000, which has grown to 40,000, which means a profit of 15,000. The return should is about 60%, i.e. 15K profit on 25K investment. zerodha.com/varsity 226",

    "text": "227 Of course, there is nothing wrong with this calculation. A\u0000er all, this is the absolute return we are calculating here. The question, however, is that did you get this 60% in the first, 2nd, or 3rd year? Was it that you got the entire return in the 1st year and since then the investment has stayed flat? Or was the return generated in the 3rd year with the first two years netting zero return? Of course, one can get into the depths of this and figure the details. But otherwise, we simply ignore the specifics and take the average growth on year on year basis. Higher the average the better investment this is. To put this in perspective, think about a road journey. Let us say you are travelling from Delhi to Jaipur by car. If I ask you at what speed you drove your car, will you tell me that your drove at 80 kmph from Delhi to Gurugram, 110 kmph from Gurugram to Panchgaon, about 90 kmph between Panchgaon to Neemrana so on and so forth or will you just tell me that you drove an average speed of 100 kmph? You won\u2019t give me the split; you will give me average speed. Likewise, when we look at a multi-year investment period, the years in between are like the town on a journey. Based on the market conditions (just like the traffic) investment generates different returns (like driving at a different speed) during these years. Some years may be positive, and few may be negative. zerodha.com/varsity 227",

Now, go back to the initial question, which was intentionally kept in bold. Do you think that is the right question? No, the real question to ask should have been \u2013 \u2018 I invest Rs.25,000/- on 1st of July 2017 in a certain Mutual Fund. Three years later, the investment has grown to Rs.40,000/-. What is the growth rate of this investment? I hope you get the subtle but a the very important distinction on the two different questions. Ok, let\u2019s go back to the Delhi and Jaipur example. I know that the average speed is 100 kmph. At this rate, how much time will you take to reach Ajmer, which is another 150 km away from Jaipur? Quite easy \u2013 I know the average speed, so you are likely to take about 1 hour 30 mins to reach Ajmer. On a similar note, I know the investment grew at 16.96%. What is the likely value of my investment if I let this investment run for another say one year? Quite easy \u2013 Current value at the end 3rd year = Rs.40,000 Growth Rate \u2013 16.96% Tenure \u2013 1 yearExpected value = 40,000*(1+16.96%) \u2014 > I\u2019m basically incrementing 40,000 by 16.96% zerodha.com/varsity 228",

The formula is Current value *( 1+ growth rate)^(time in year) = 40000*(1+16.96%)^(3) = Rs.64,000/- This is also called the future value of the investment given a certain growth rate. I hope you now appreciate why we need to consider the CAGR and not absolute return if the investment is more than one year. One last thing you need to note \u2013 Higher the average speed, faster you will reach your destination. High speed also comes with high risk. Likewise, higher the CAGR, higher is the rate at which your investment is growing. The risk too is high in such investments as there could be fears of a crash in the underlying asset prices. Anyway, I hope you are now clear about the distinction between absolute return and CAGR and when to use which one.

The traditional CAGR also does not help because there are multiples investments across multiple periods. However, we still use CAGR, but with slight modifications.

To get an accurate representation of how the two-year return (growth rate) looks, you need to calculate the \u2018Rolling Returns\u2019. 19.2 \u2013 Rolling Return The rolling return gives us a perspective of how the \u2018n years\u2019 return (growth) has evolved over the last \u2018n years\u2019. Sounds confusing? I\u2019m sure it is, so here is what we will do. We will take up an example and figure out the rolling return calculation. I\u2019m sure understanding the rolling return concept becomes much easier if you know the math behind. zerodha.com/varsity 239",

Next, I move the date by one day, i.e. between 3rd January 2015 and 3rd January 2013, take the NAV for these two dates and calculate the return between these dates. I\u2019ll again move the date by one day, i.e. 4th January 2015/2013 and calculate the return. So on and so forth, such that I have a time series of 2-year return.

Also, at this point, you should realize that if my objective were to calculate the 1-year rolling return, my starting point would be 2014, and if the objective is to estimate three years rolling return, then I would start from 2016. Now that we have the Rolling Return time series starting from 2015, I can do a couple of things with the data. To begin with, we can calculate the range of returns for the time series we have calculated. To estimate the range, we simply have to calculate the max and min.

Continuing from the previous chapter, we will discuss a few more important metrics related to mutual funds. In this chapter, we focus on the expense ratio of a mutual fund. Of course, this is the 20th chapter in this module, and I suppose we have mentioned \u2018expense ratio\u2019, in passing multiples times. However, we never formally introduced the concept of the expense ratio of a mutual fund. So let us do that before we proceed. Think about services like Tata Sky, Netflix, Swiggy, or even Dunzo, these are all services that you consume fairly regularly (I assume) and therefore you pay for it. Why would you pay for it? Well, because there is a real cost involved. For example, a Dunzo executive has to ride his bike to the store, pick up the item, deliver the same to your house. So there is fuel, labour, tech, and other expenses involved. Hence we pay a fee to cover for these costs plus a tiny bit extra which adds to the profit of the company. zerodha.com/varsity 247",

The fee mutual fund charges are called, \u2018The Total Expense Ratio\u2019 or TER. Why do the AMCs charge? Well, they have expenses to bear \u2013 custodian fees, Trustee, RTAs, fund managers, admin, brokers, distributors, advertisements, and of course, as a business, they need to be profitable too. At this point, there are two possible paths available to us \u2013 deep dive into what, why, how of TER or get a working knowledge of TER. I prefer we stick to the later. As a Mutual fund investor, all you need to be aware of is that mutual fund investments are not free, and you have to pay for it. However, most of the first time investors would like to believe that mutual fund investments are free because they never make an explicit payment to an AMC for the fund management services. In fact, no one explicitly pays an AMC. The service fee, i.e. the TER is charged in a very convenient and hassle-free manner, so much so that you wouldn\u2019t even know you\u2019ve paid for it J.

    "text": "249 I\u2019ll use a very simplified example and address these questions. The idea is to give you rough working knowledge on TER and not the exact math behind. Assume a certain AMC charges a TER of 1%, i.e. a fee of Rs.1,000/- per year for every Rs.1,00,000/- invested. Now, this fee is not collected from you the moment you invest or on a monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or yearly basis. The fee is collected from you daily, without even you being aware of it. Let me explain \u2013 Rs.1,000/- is the charge on an annual basis. If you do the math, this works out to \u2013 1,0000/365 =Rs.2.73/- So as long as you are invested, Rs.2.73/- is deducted from your funds daily. The question is, how do they charge and take this money on a daily basis. Assume the starting NAV of the fund is Rs.10/-. Since you\u2019ve invested Rs.1,00,000/- you are entitled to receive = Rs.1,00,000/10 = 10,000 units. A\u0000er you invest, assume the very next day the fund gains 1%. That means, the new NAV is \u2013 =10*(1+1%) = 10.1 zerodha.com/varsity 249",

Hence they will deduct this money from the value of your investment = Rs.1,01,000/- minus Rs.2.73/- = Rs.1,00,997.3/- Or the actual NAV applicable (and declared) is \u2013 = Rs.1,00,997.3 / 10,000 = 10.09973. Note, the NAV is 10.09973 a\u0000er deducting the TER. Before TER the NAV is 10.1. So the point to note is \u2013 \u25cf The NAV that is declared is a\u0000er deducting the TER \u25cf The money is collected from you from your investments \u25cf Money is deducted daily Now in the example, we worked with the assumption that the value of the investments increases by 1%. Even if the value of the fund decreased, the fund will still go ahead and charge what they are supposed to charge. Besides, there are plenty of nuances to TER calculation.

The fund should also consider the weighted average sum of your investments. So as you can imagine, there are many subtleties involved. There are professional \u2018fund accounting\u2019 companies which incorporate the SEBI guidelines and help the AMCs do the math and ascertain the TER on a weighted average basis. As an investor, I don\u2019t think it is necessary to dwell into these technicalities as long as you know much you are paying. Also, when you are selecting a fund for investment, the TER is not a standalone factor to consider. TER is no doubt important, but just because a fund is charging say 2%, you should not ignore everything else about the fund and decide not to invest. Yes, if you have to shortlist between two funds of the same type including the return profile, for example, an overnight fund, then it makes sense to look at the fund with a lower TER and invest in it.

My favourite was Joy Ice cream, not because it was any different than Vadilal, but because the Joy Ice cream factory was 500 meters from my house. It was a small factory with a little retail outlet at the factory\u2019s entrance. At this factory-owned retail outlet, a choco bar stick was sold at Rs.14/- whereas the same was sold at Rs.18/- in a shop called \u2018Anu stores\u2019, which still is about 1km away. Whenever my parents felt generous, they would give me some money to buy ice creams; I\u2019d run to the factory retail shop and pick up a couple of ice cream sticks for the family.

Well, because the owner of Anu stores needed an incentive to sell Joy ice cream. Without the incentive, why would anyone sell a product, right? That\u2019s the reason Joy Ice cream as a company would mark up the price to include the shop owners incentive and sell the choco bar at Rs.18/-. However, at the factor\u2019s retail outlet, there is no incentive because the Joy Ice cream as a company would make whatever it had to make by selling the ice cream directly to the customer at Rs.14/-.

The direct transaction is comparable to me buying the ice creme from the factory owned retail outlet. However, if you buy a mutual fund from a distributor, then it is comparable to buying the ice cream from Anu stores. Now the seller of a regular mutual fund needs an incentive to sell the mutual fund; hence the AMC marks up the TER and passes the additional TER to the distributor and the distributor network. Hence, for any given fund, the TER or the expense ratio for a regular fund will always be higher compared to the direct fund. Which leads us to an important point \u2013 every mutual fund scheme is available in two avatars or two plans \u2013 \u25cf Direct Plan \u25cf Regular Plan While everything remains the same, only the TER changes.

The first in the list is the direct plan, where they have explicitly mentioned that it is a direct plan. The second in the list is the regular plan. The AMC has not explicitly mentioned that it is a regular plan, but is implied. The TER for both these funds is different. Here is the snapshot \u2013 The TER for Direct is 1.28%, and Regular is 1.78%. The additional TER of 0.5% in the regular fund is to ensure the distributor is adequately compensated for selling the Mutual Fund. It is very important to comprehend the fact that the TER is paid by you, i.e. the investor to the AMC and therefore the distributor. When you buy from the AMC directly, there is no distributor, hence no distributor commission, hence lesser TER. The lesser the TER, the higher the returns for you. At this stage, you may be clear about the fact that the TER for regular funds is higher compared to its direct counterpart. You may have also understood the fact that the fund is the same \u2013 same strategy, same portfolio, same fund manager, same risk, etc., but the TER or the expense ratio is different. zerodha.com/varsity 255",

The distributor could be an online website as well, where you buy the mutual fund yourself. Regardless of who the distributor is, you need to remember that when you buy a regular MF, you are paying a higher TER fee. Does that mean buying a regular plan and paying a higher TER is bad? Well, no. If you know nothing about Mutual fund investment, and you need help with this, then you should opt for an advisor who will advise and keep track of everything on your behalf (markets, MF performance, rebalancing etc.). Under such a circumstance, it makes sense to buy a regular MF from the agent to compensate him or her for the advisory work and the continuous hand holding services. zerodha.com/varsity 256",

You are better off investing in a direct fund and save on costs. Hopefully, this explains who these distributors are and why one should opt or not opt for regular funds. The last question, i.e. why the NAV of direct funds is higher compared to a regular fund is perhaps the most asked question. The confusion is this \u2013 the NAV of the regular fund is lesser. Hence the units are available for a cheaper price, why pay more for the direct fund given the fact that the NAV for direct funds is higher. For example, look at the NAVs for HDFC Top 100 fund \u2013 \u25cf Direct plan NAV is 460.5 \u25cf Regular plan NAV is 438.4 The difference is almost Rs.22/- per unit. It is only natural to want to buy the regular fund considering it is cheaper. Well, the problem is in the way we perceive the NAV. If you look at NAV as a price you pay to acquire the mutual fund, then, yes, the regular fund NAV looks cheaper, and it seems like a smart decision to pay a lesser amount and buy the regular plan. However, if you look at the NAV not as an asset price, but rather as the value of an asset, then you will soon realise that the regular plan is less valuable zerodha.com/varsity 257",

But do recall from the previous chapter, the value of units in direct funds is always much higher compared to the regular fund. As you can see, the investment value in direct is Rs.9,99,527/- versus the value of Rs.9,52,000/- in the regular fund. The difference is Rs.47,527/- or about 6.51% when compared to the initial investment amount. Where do you think this money is going? Well, the money is going to the distributor for having advised you to start a 10,000/- SIP five years ago. Now obviously in the direct fund, the distributor does not make this commission. Hence the returns are higher, this is quite evident when you look at the XIRR as well \u2013 10.47% Direct Fund XIRR versus Regular plan\u2019s 8.84%. Which implies, that every year you end up paying 1.63% of your investment value as commissions.

Benchmarking, in the mutual fund world, is used to measure the performance of a fund.

It would be hard to say unless we know how much time Y takes to clear the same track, right? Assume, Y takes 13 seconds. Now, who is likely to win the race? Y, right? We were able to answer (or predict) this because we could benchmark both X and Y against each other.

For example, a large-cap equity fund benchmarks itself against the Ni\u0000y 50 Index.

    "text": "265 To put this in context, assume an Equity fund generates 12% CAGR across three years while its benchmark, i.e. Ni\u0000y 50 generates 10.5% for the same period. In this case, the fund is said to have outperformed. The excess return with respect to the benchmark is called the \u2018Alpha\u2019. In this case, the Alpha is 1.5% i.e. 12% \u2013 10.5%. By the way, in the snapshot above, you must have noticed the \u2018TRI\u2019bit. TRI stands for Total Return Index. The total return index includes and factors in for dividends as well. Remember, when you buy a stock of a company, there are two sources of income \u2013 1. Price appreciation or capital gains 2. Dividend income Now, think about the regular index chart that all of us check. This chart captures only the price appreciation of the index. It does not capture the dividends issued by the index constituents. To get a sense of real returns an investor earns, one has to factor in for the dividends received by the company. The total returns index (TRI) captures this. So when we look at the Ni\u0000y 50 chart, we are essentially looking at just the price appreciation chart, but when we are looking at the Ni\u0000y 50 TRI, we are looking at both price appreciation, and the dividends received. Have a look at a comparison of Ni\u0000y 50 and Ni\u0000y 50 TRI, the blue line is TRI and red is Ni\u0000y 50 \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 265",

B manages an Equity multi opportunity fund and benchmarks his funds against Ni\u0000y 500 TRI. Which mutual fund manager here do you think will have a tough time beating their benchmark? Ni\u0000y 50 has 50 large-cap stock, while Ni\u0000y 500 has not only the 50 stocks from Ni\u0000y 50 but an additional 450 stocks. Intuitively, it feels as if beating the Ni\u0000y 500 TRI seems like a more challenging task. A\u0000er all, Ni\u0000y 500 is diversified, has more stocks, lesser volatility, and therefore drawdowns are contained. Well, but it\u2019s not. The reason for this is interesting. Let me explain this. Imagine you have created an imaginary index, call it the \u2018High 5\u2019 index. High five consists of the top 5 stocks across five different sectors. The constituents of the index are as follows \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 267",

    "text": "268 Each stock has a certain weight in the index. The starting value of the index is 1000; the Base Split column shows you the split of 1000 according to the weight of the individual stocks in the index. With this, assume you start your index. A\u0000er a few days, the stock prices have changed, which means the index value also varies. I\u2019ve randomly assigned stock price values to the High five index stocks \u2013 As a virtue of the change in stock price, the individual base values change, hence the entire index changes. Given the stock price changes, the overall index value changes, and as you can see, the index changed from 1000 (starting price) to 1,081.72, representing an absolute return of 8.17%. Now, let\u2019s not change anything in the high five indexes, let the stocks remain the same, the reference stock prices will stay the same, and even the starting value of the index remains the same. We will only change the weights assigned to individual stocks and see what happens to the index values. Have a look at the snapshot below \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 268",

Likewise for other stocks as well. With the change in weights, look at the new base value, that too has changed from 1,081.72 to 1,056.51. With no shi\u0000 in stocks, but with a change in weights, the returns have decreased to 5.65% from 8.17%. What does this mean? This means that the weights you assign to the stocks within an index matter the most. Whether you have 50 stocks or 500 stocks in the index is pointless, what you need to look at it the weights assigned to each stock. For example, in Ni\u0000y 500, the top 10 stock has a weightage of nearly 45%, the top 25 has a weightage close to 65%, top 50 has nearly 85-90% of the weightage. The rest 450 stocks exist, for the sake of it. \ud83d\ude0a To put this in a more meaningful context, do check the rolling returns of Ni\u0000y 50 TRI and Ni\u0000y 500 TRI.

So the question is \u2013 what difference does it make if the benchmark is Ni\u0000y 50 TRI or Ni\u0000y 500 TRI? Well, nothing. What does this mean to you as a mutual fund investor? I suppose some of you are reading this may have figured this out already. Don\u2019t worry too much about MF benchmarking. You as an investor, should develop a sense of realistic return expectation from your MF investments. That realistic return expectation should serve as your benchmark for the investment and not the one assigned by the AMC. Everything else is noise according to me. Naturally, this further boils down to setting realistic return expectations in life. For example, if you\u2019ve predominantly invested in a large-cap fund, then you should expect large-cap kind of results and not small-cap kind returns. \ud83d\ude0a Having said that, if the fund you\u2019ve invested in is under-performing the index consistently then that is not a good sign either. Under such circumstances, you may want to consider a review or even change of fund.

    "text": "274 One of the key attributes of the mutual fund is the \u2018beta\u2019 of the fund. The beta of a mutual fund is the measure of relative risk, expressed as number; Beta can take any value above or below zero. Beta gives us a perspective of the relative risk of the mutual fund vis a vis its benchmark. I\u2019ll not get into the details of how beta is calculated, I\u2019ve done that in the Future\u2019s module. Here is the link if you are interested to know the math behind \u2013 https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/hedging-futures/ Section 11.5 of this chapter discusses the beta in detail. For this chapter, I\u2019ll restrict myself to the application of beta and how you need to use this number. Have a look at the snapshot below \u2013 I\u2019ve captured this from Value research; these attributes belong to Tata Multicap fund. As you can see, the fund is benchmarked against S&P BSE 500 TRI. I\u2019ve highlighted the beta of the fund, which is 0.95. Like I mentioned earlier, beta gives us a measure of the relative risk of the fund. In general, If the beta of a mutual fund is less than 1, then the fund is perceived as less risky compared to its benchmark. For example, the Tata Multicap fund has a zerodha.com/varsity 274",

    "text": "275 beta of 0.95, hence the fund is slightly less risky compared to its benchmark. I say slightly because it\u2019s very close to 1. This implies, if S&P Sensex 500 falls by 1%, then Tata Multicap fund is expected to fall by 0.95%. If the beta was 0.6 or 0.65, the fund is less risk or less volatile compared to its benchmark. Why? Because if S&P Sensex 500 falls by 1%, then Tata Multicap fund is expected to fall by only 0.65% and not 0.95%. This is what I mean by \u2018relative risk\u2019; it gives us a perspective of how risky the fund is compared to its benchmark. Now, if the beta of a mutual fund is equal to 1, then it means the fund is as risky as its benchmark. For example, if the benchmark falls by 1%, the fund is expected to fall by 1%. So both the benchmark and the fund are expected to have similar risk profiles. Lastly, if the beta of the fund is higher than 1, it implies that the fund is risker compared to its benchmark. For instance, a beta of 1.2 suggests that the fund is 20% riskier compared to its benchmark. If the benchmark falls by 1%, the fund is expected to fall by 1.2%. When you are looking at the Beta of a stock or an MF, it is very important to recognize the fact that the beta is a measure of relative risk, it tells us how risky the stock or MF is compared to its benchmark. Beta is not an indicator of the inherent risk of the stock or MF. To put this in context, think about it this way, Ferrari is faster compared to a BMW, this comparison is like the beta. We measure the speed of car one against car two. But does this give you any indication of how fast the Ferrari is? Not really. zerodha.com/varsity 275",

By now, you must have a built your perception of beta. Let me ask you this \u2013 if a mutual fund has a high beta, do you think it is bad? Well, the good, bad, ugly part of beta depends on another metric called the \u2018 Alpha \u2019. 22.2 \u2013 Alpha In the previous chapter, we briefly discussed alpha. We defined alpha as the excess return of the fund over and above the benchmark returns. Well, that is true, but we need to make a few small changes to that equation and include our newly introduced friend, beta. To understand alpha, we need to understand the concept of \u2018Risk-free\u2019 return. The risk-free return is the maximum return you can generate without taking any risk. By risk I mean \u2013 market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, and unsystematic risk. There are two return sources which fit in the above definition \u2013 (1) The return from the savings bank account (2) The fixed deposit return. Of course, we can argue that the banks too are not safe and come with some degree of risk. Understandable, but let\u2019s keep that argument aside for this discussion \ud83d\ude0a Or if you are a stickler for definitions, let us stick to the treasury bills, issued by the Govt of India.

Let\u2019s apply the for formula and check \u2013 Alpha = (10%-4%)-(7%-4%)*0.75 = 6% \u2013 2.25% = 3.75% As you can see, the alpha is not just the difference between the fund and its benchmark, which if true, the alpha would have been \u2013 10% \u2013 7% =3% But rather, the alpha is 3.75%. Now, many of you may not find this intuitive. You may question where the additional 0.75% comes from. Well, think about it, the fund has managed to generate a 10% return compared to the Index\u2019s 7% while managing to stay significantly less volatile (remember beta is just 0.75). Hence we are rewarding the fund for its good behaviour or less volatile behaviour. Therefore the alpha is 3.75% as opposed to just 3%.

While the returns remain the same, thanks to beta, the alpha is significantly lesser on a risk-adjusted basis. To conclude, alpha is the excess return of the fund over above the benchmark returns. Alpha is risk-adjusted. The fund is rewarded if the returns are generated by keeping a low-risk profile and penalized for being volatile. By now, you must have realized that volatility plays an important role in measuring mutual funds performance. Beta is a measure of volatility; it tells us how risky the fund is when compared to its benchmark. Beta is a relative risk and does not reveal the fund\u2019s inherent risk.

Anyway, while at it, check the Alpha and Beta of both these funds. Few observations \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 281",

    "text": "282 \u25cf The beta of both the funds is sub 1, which means compared to their benchmark they are relatively less risky. But how risky are they individually? We can answer this by looking at the SD \u25cf Alpha is a positive number for both the funds, which is a good thing. The Alpha for Axis small-cap fund is quite impressive. I\u2019d guess this is because of the low beta factor plus the low risk-free return prevailing in the economy. I hope the risk parameters are starting to make sense to you. We will now shi\u0000 focus to another parameter called the \u2018Sharpe Ratio\u2019. 22.4 \u2013 Sharpe Ratio Sharpe Ratio is one of the most sacred formulas in Finance. It was invented by Willam F Sharpe, an American Economist in the year in 1966. He was awarded the Nobel prize in 1990 for his work on the Capital asset pricing model. Assume, there are two large-cap funds -Fund A and Fund B. Here is how they have performed in terms of returns \u2013 Fund A \u2013 14% Fund B \u2013 16% Which of the two funds are better? Well, Fund B has a higher return, so without a doubt, Fund B is a better fund. Now, consider the following \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 282",

Now, which of the two funds do you think is better? I guess it gets a little complex to figure out which these two funds are better given that we have to evaluate them on two parameters, i.e. both the risk and return. Ignoring the risk, purely on a return basis, Fund B is better. Ignoring the return, purely on a risk basis, Fund A is better. But in reality, you cannot isolate risk and reward; you need to factor in both these and figure out which of these two are better. The Sharpe Ratio helps us here. It bundles the concept of risk, reward, and the risk-free rate and gives us a perspective. Sharpe ratio = [Fund Return \u2013 Risk-Free Return]/Standard Deviation of the fund Let's apply the math for Fund A \u2013 = [14% \u2013 6%] / 28% = 8%/28% = 0.29 zerodha.com/varsity 283",

    "text": "284 The number tells us that the fund generates 0.29 units of return (over and above the risk-free return) for every unit of risk undertaken. Naturally, by this measure, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better it is as we all want higher returns for every unit of risk undertaken. Lets see how this turns out for Fund B \u2013 = [16% \u2013 6% ] / 34% = 10% / 34% = 0.29 So it turns out that both the funds are similar in terms of their risk and reward perspective. And there is no advantage of choosing Fund A over Fund B. Now, instead of 34% standard deviation, assume Fund B\u2019s standard Deviation is 18%. [16% \u2013 6% ] / 18% = 10% / 18% = 0.56 In this case, Fund B is a better choice because Fund B generates more return for every unit of risk undertaken. Do note, Sharpe ratio considers only price based risk. It does not consider credit or interest rate risk. Hence, there is no point looking at the Sharpe ratio for debt funds. zerodha.com/varsity 284",

    "text": "286 CHAPTER 23 Sortino and the Capture Ratios 23.1 \u2013 The Sortino\u2019s Ratio In this chapter, we will discuss two other ratios related to the mutual fund performance/risk measures, i.e. the Sortino Ratio and the Capture Ratios. These are fairly easy to understand, so we will try to keep this chapter as a short note. We discussed the Sharpe Ratio in the previous chapter. The formula, if you remember looks like this \u2013 Sharpe ratio = [Fund Return \u2013 Risk-Free Return]/Standard deviation of the fund I want you to think about the denominator. The denominator has \u2018Standard Deviation\u2019, which, as you know, is an assessment of risk. What sort of risk? Well, we are talking about the risk of the returns varying from the average expected returns. Read that line again; we are defining risk as to the variation (or the variance) from the average expected returns. The variance can be both positive or negative. Let me explain, have a look at the image below \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 286",

I\u2019ve calculated the daily return for the fund for the time series, and I\u2019ve also calculated the average daily return for the time series. The average return is 0.108%. Further, I calculate the excess return by subtracting the average return from the actual return. For example, the daily return for 4th August 2020 was 1.23%, the average return is 0.108%. Hence, Excess Return \u2013 = 1.23% \u2013 0.108% = 1.13%. zerodha.com/varsity 287",

    "text": "288 Of course, you square this return to get the variance, from which you further calculate the standard deviation or the risk. The point that I want to make here is that when you take the excess return, you get both positive and negative values. A positive value indicates a profit and negative value indicates a loss. Now, let us look at the Sharpe ratio again \u2013 Sharpe ratio = [Fund Return \u2013 Risk-Free Return]/Standard deviation of the fund By, using the \u2018standard deviation\u2019 in the denominator, we try to adjust the returns per unit of risk. However, the risk contains both positive and negative returns. A\u0000er all, we do not want to penalize the fund for a positive return; we need to scrutinize it for only the negative returns. The Sortino\u2019s ratio helps in this regard. The Sortino\u2019s ratio is an improvisation over the Sharpe Ratio, wherein the denominator has only the negative returns or the \u2018downside risk\u2019, is considered. Hence, the Sortino\u2019s Ratio is \u2013 = [Fund Return \u2013 Risk-Free Return]/Downside Risk The objective of Sortino\u2019s ratio is to estimate the excess return adjusted for only the downside risk. Like the Sharpe ratio, higher the Sortino\u2019s ratio, better it is. zerodha.com/varsity 288",

In my opinion, the capture ratios overshadow all other metrics and get straight to the point. Before I discuss these capture ratios, let me tell you a quick story from my college days. We were a group of friends in the first year of Engineering; we were young, restless, and misguided in life. \ud83d\ude0a We were about 8-10 of us, always moved around in a group. Played cricket all day long, missed classroom sessions, and would sit in the parking lot spending hours talking about useless things in life. I must agree; it was a lot of fun \ud83d\ude0a . So much fun that we at times ignored exams around the corner, to the extent that most of us would barely manage to get a passing mark. But there was this one guy in the group who was a little different. He would spend time with the rest of the gang, hang out, chit chat, play cricket, and go back home late. He would have all the fun the entire group had. However, around exam time, he would go back home to study and managed to do better than the rest of the group. Not that he scored great marks, but he certainly did better than the rest of us. zerodha.com/varsity 289",

But why am I telling you this story? Well, there is a reason for it. Please think about this smart friend of mine. While he had 100% of the fun with the group, he knew when to cut the slack. He knew it was too risky to not study for the exams. It may sound weird, but let\u2019s extend this to mutual funds. Imagine this friend of mine as a mutual fund and the rest of us as the mutual fund\u2019s benchmark. When the group (or the benchmark) was having fun (or let\u2019s say generating positive returns), so did this friend of mine(the mutual fund) to his full capacity. When it was time to study, the group (benchmark) suffered (think of it as a negative return), but this friend had good risk management practise, he scored better than the group. zerodha.com/varsity 290",

The capture ratio tells us, for a given period, to what extent did the fund capture the positive returns of its benchmark and also to what extent it captured the negative returns from the benchmark. Here is an example \u2013 This is the capture ratio of HDFC Top 100, Direct, Growth fund on a 3-year basis. I\u2019ve taken this from Morningstar India website. The fund has an upside capture ratio of 99, which implies that the fund has managed to capture 99% of the Index\u2019s up move. Likewise, the downside capture ratio is 119, which means that the fund has captured 119% of the downside returns of the Index. The math behind capture ratio is elementary, but I\u2019ll skip that since as an investor, you\u2019d not need it. All I want you to remember is that the upside capture ratio conveys the extent to which the fund captures all the positive returns of its benchmark. The downside capture ratio indicates the extent to which the fund captures (or rather avoided) the negative returns of its benchmark. zerodha.com/varsity 291",

    "text": "292 Given this, ask yourself, what should be the ideal capture ratio of a mutual fund? Well, we would want the fund which captures 100% of the upside if not more. At the same time, we would want the downside capture ratio to be as low as possible. Well, this is not easy \ud83d\ude0a A fund will either have a great upside or a great downside capture ratio, but not both. A fund either has a great upside capture ratio along with a disappointing downside capture (like this HDFC fund) or you will find the other way round, where the upside capture is low and so is the downside capture. Check this \u2013 This is the capture ratio for the Parag Parikh Long term equity fund on a 3-year basis. While the upside is not impressive at all, the downside capture ratio is quite impressive. So the point is that it is always a trade-off. You, as an investor, need to be clear on this \u2013 do you want the fund to be aggressive in chasing returns or do you want the fund to have a great risk management practice? I prefer to look at the latter. I like funds which manage the risk better, and I evaluate this by looking at the consistency of the downside capture ratio, over many years. zerodha.com/varsity 292",

I like the consistency in risk management here, and I\u2019d value this far higher than the upside capture ratio. By the way, the 3, 5, and 10 year upside capture ratio is 98, 103, 104 for the same fund, which is not bad at all. Also, it does not matter if you choose to analyse the upside or downside capture ratio; what matters is the consistency. Hence it\u2019s important to look at capture ratios across multiple years. I usually check the capture ratios on the Morningstar India website. I\u2019m not sure if these ratios are listed anywhere else. And with this and everything else we have discussed in the previous chapter, I hope you\u2019ve got a sense of all the different mutual fund metrics. The next few chapters will focus on analyzing a mutual fund and building a mutual fund portfolio for specific financial goals. Stay tuned.

We are now at an interesting junction as we steer our way to the final leg of this module, i.e. to figure ways to build mutual fund portfolios to help us achieve various financial goals in our lives. If you think about it, building a mutual fund portfolio has three parts to it \u2013 1. Identify a financial goal (it can be any) and translate that financial goal in terms of time and corpus. For example here is a financial goal \u2013 40 lakh (in today\u2019s terms) for my 10-year-old kid\u2019s Post-graduation degree in the US. If you break this down, it translates to a requirement of Rs.40L (adjusted to inflation) in 15 years 2. Identification of funds to help you achieve the financial goal 3. Periodic review and maintenance of the portfolio. In my view, the first and third point is fairly easy. It\u2019s the 2nd point, i.e. the actual act of building a portfolio is the tricky bit. If you isolate just the 2nd point, then you will realize that it is made up three things \u2013 \u25cb Analyze funds, pick the right ones and avoid investing in the bad ones \u25cb Figure the portfolio composition \u2013 just equity, just debt, a mix of equity and debt etc. zerodha.com/varsity 296",

I like to keep the process simple and stick to things that I\u2019m most concerned about, i.e. the fund\u2019s ability to manage risk and generate returns.

Do not treat this as a recommendation of any sort \ud83d\ude0a Remember, direct funds are relatively new and may not have the necessary historical information; hence we are looking at the regular funds. The first step is to run a few basic hygiene checks, which includes some of the good to know information about the fund. Usually, this information is available in the fund\u2019s fact sheet.

Anyway, the fund has an AUM of Rs.29,500 Cr, which makes it a large fund. From the AMC perspective, how large is this fund? To figure that out, you need to look at AMC's overall AUM. The AUM information is updated on the AMC website regularly. As you can see, Kotak AMC has an AUM of 1.5L Crore, which makes the standard equity fund about 18% of the overall AUM. However, suppose you look at the Equity category. In that case, the AUM is about 40,000 Crore, which means the Kotak Standard Equity Fund is nearly 72% of the category AUM, which implies that this is one of their flagship funds for the category. zerodha.com/varsity 301",

I know many folks fret about the \u2018large AUM\u2019 problem, the rationale being that the fund manager may find it difficult to manage the funds as the opportunity shrinks. If the fund flow is steady and the AUM increases gradually over time, then, in my opinion, it should be ok. However, if there is a drastic increase in AUM, maybe because of aggressive marketing campaigns, then that could be a problem and usually results in a slight lag in the performance. Smaller funds do have an advantage in terms of nimbleness. Apart from the AUM size, we look at the expense ratio of the fund, direct is at 0.73% and regular is at 1.69%.

In this case, the Sharpe ratio is negative, which means either the risk-free return is higher compared to the portfolio\u2019s return or the portfolio\u2019s expected returns are negative. Either way, this is not conclusive. Hence we can ignore the Sharpe ratio. Check the Alpha and the beta of the fund to get a sense of the fund's performance compared to the category. Of course, you need to do this across 3, 5, and 10 year periods. Usually, the fund\u2019s hygiene check ends at this point. All that we do in this stage is to gather a few important \u2018good to know\u2019 data points. zerodha.com/varsity 303",

By studying the past returns and its behaviour, we would at least know what to expect. By past returns, I don\u2019t mean 1,3,6 or 12 months returns. In fact, in my opinion, anything less than three years return is pointless when it comes to Equity returns. Three years itself is an ok time frame, I\u2019d suggest five years or higher, but three years is a good start. We start by looking at the rolling returns. By the way, I hope you know what rolling returns mean, else I\u2019d suggest you look at the chapter and familiarize yourself with the same. I\u2019ll post a series of rolling return snapshots sourced from Rupeevest website. Hopefully, soon we will have Rolling returns of funds on Coin, our mutual fund platform.

The first thing that will catch your attention is the spread between the two rolling returns. The blue line is consistently above the grey line, indicating that the fund has delivered better returns compared to its benchmark. In the three years, the fund has delivered an average return of 15.2% while the benchmark has delivered 9.87%. The moment you see such an outperformance, rather than getting excited, you need to pause and ask yourself \u2013 how is this fund pulling this off. Is the fund taking in more risk compared to its benchmark? We will figure that out soon. While the spread between the fund and its benchmark was significant in the initial years, it has shrunk since mid-2018. zerodha.com/varsity 305",

It is important to understand that you are looking at the 3-year data, but just the 3-years data is not sufficient for analyzing an Equity mutual fund, we need to look at five and 10-year data as well to get a perspective.

    "text": "308 The answer to the first question is tricky. There is no fund manager change, so its unlikely the investment style has changed. Is this because the fund has a large AUM? Well, this is a tough call to make, but my gut says this could as well be the reason. Have a look at the trailing returns as on date \u2013 We can see the fund has underperformed the benchmark on a 3-year basis, while it is at par on a 5-year basis, and on the 10-year basis, it still has a slight outperformance. All in all, it gives me a perspective that the returns were great in the past years, but will that continue is the question. However, the interesting bit that the performance has been better than its peers look at the Equity Multi cap category performance. As far as the 2nd concern goes, let us focus on the risk metrics of the fund, perhaps the most crucial bit of our analysis. 24.4 \u2013 Risk \u2013 Return matrix check I find the risk-reward matrix published by Morningstar quite useful.

The red square belongs to the benchmark, and from its positioning in the matrix, we can conclude the benchmark has generated a return of 10% by taking the risk of 19%. Now, look at the yellow button; it belongs to the category. We can see that the yellow button is on the same vertical plane as the red square. Hence we can conclude that the average category risk is similar to that of the benchmark\u2019s risk, i.e. 19%. Unfortunately, for 19% risk, the category\u2019s return does not match upto its benchmark, as it is slightly below the benchmark\u2019s return. So if you were to choose an investment between the category and its benchmark, it does not make sense to invest in the category since for similar risk, the benchmark offers better returns. What about the fund in perspective? Well, the fund has a better risk-reward ratio compared to the benchmark. It seems to have generated similar returns like the benchmark by taking on lesser risk, which in my opinion is good. Remember, you are paying the fund manager for active management. Active management does not necessarily mean generating better than benchmark return. I think job is well done if the fund manager can generate similar returns like the benchmark by taking on lesser risk (at a lower cost hopefully). So on a 5-year mark, this is looking good.

The idea was to highlight the steps involved in analyzing an equity mutual fund. Of course, towards the end of the previous chapter, we also figured that the fund was indeed good, especially when it comes to risk management. The question is \u2013 since the fund is good, should you invest in the fund and include it in your mutual fund portfolio? While on the face of it, it appears like a no brainer, we've analyzed the fund across both risks and return parameters. The fund ticks off well on all the good qualities, so it makes sense to invest. However, the decision to invest in a fund (and therefore include it in your portfolio) should not stem from how good or bad the fund is. The decision to invest in a fund should come from the objective of your mutual fund portfolio. Remember, the objective serves a financial goal. Now, for example, if my financial goal is to build an emergency corpus, then investing in Equity funds may not make sense. So it does not matter how good the fund is, there is no question of investing. zerodha.com/varsity 314",

It makes sense to take a specific tablet which addresses your knee pain. Likewise, an investment should be made only when the portfolio\u2019s objective and the fund\u2019s risk-reward profile matches. In case, you do not follow this approach of aligning the two; then you will most likely end up with a \u2018confused portfolio\u2019. Over the next few chapters, we will discuss how to align funds with portfolio goals, but before we do that, in this chapter lets discuss how to analyze a debt mutual fund. zerodha.com/varsity 315",

    "text": "316 25.2 \u2013 Risk recap Like in the previous chapter, in this chapter we will pick a debt mutual fund and analyze the fund. But before we do that, I\u2019d like to quickly touch upon the major risks associated with a debt fund. Credit risk \u2013 Remember the debt MF invests its money in debt obligations. For example, company A wants to borrow 50Cr to fund its operations, decides to float a 5-year bond by paying an interest of 9%. AMC X decides to invest in this bond. Assuming things go smoothly, the company gets the funds, and the AMC gets the interest payment. At the end of 5 years, the company is expected to repay the principal. As you can imagine, this is fairly standard practice. The problem arises if something goes wrong with the company during these five years and the company is unable to service the interest payment on time. If things get worse, the company can even throw their hand up in the air and say, \u2018sorry\u2019, no cash to repay the principal or the interest. All AMCs running debt funds carry this risk, i.e. the risk of default; this is called the \u2018credit risk\u2019. Many funds in the past have taken a hit due to such defaults. Now, there is a variation to credit risk. Imagine that as on today, everything is going good for company A, but there is trouble brewing within the company and the credit rating agencies identify the same. The rating agencies downgrade the company\u2019s creditworthiness and lower the credit rating from say AAA to AA. The act of lowering the credit rating itself is a risk; this is called, \u2018credit rating risk\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 316",

    "text": "317 Interest rate risk \u2013 Bonds prices are sensitive to interest rate changes, both bond prices and interest rates are inversely related. We have discussed this earlier. A fall in interest rate tends to increase the bond prices (which means the NAV tends to increase) and increase in interest rate tends to decrease the bond prices, and therefore the mutual fund\u2019s NAV. The sensitivity of the bond prices to the interest rate risk is captured by \u2018modified duration\u2019 of the bond. Higher the modified duration, higher is the risk associated with the changes in interest rate. When a debt mutual fund reports the modified duration, then it is the aggregate modified duration across the various bonds they hold. Alright, now that we had a quick refresher on the risks involved, let us focus our efforts towards analyzing a debt mutual fund. 25.3 \u2013 Portfolio check I\u2019ve mentioned this earlier in this chapter; I\u2019d like to say it again, invest in a fund not because it is good or spectacular, invest in it because it aligns with your portfolio goals. Debt funds allure many investors because of the popular perception that it is low risk. O\u0000en debt funds get sold as a safe haven for your capital, an alternative to the bank\u2019s fixed deposit. But it is not. I\u2019m not saying this to discourage you from investing in a debt fund; I\u2019m reiterating this to highlight the fact that debt funds are not risk-free. Debt funds can be volatile and can cause a permanent loss of capital. zerodha.com/varsity 317",

The idea is to lay down a template using which you can analyze any debt fund of your choice. Much of the analysis in a debt fund is centred around the risk and the fund\u2019s portfolio, so this will be very different compared to the equity fund analysis. The fund itself is relatively new, with its NFO sometime in early 2018, so it does not have many data points to track, but it is ok. As the name of fund indicates, this is a short-term fund, meaning the fund will invest in bonds which have short term maturities ranging between 1 to 3 years. Have a look at the average maturity graph of the fund, sourced from the AMC website \u2013 The average maturity of the fund is roughly around 2.5 years, which means that the fund is susceptible to default risk, credit rating risk, interest rate risk, and the \u2018change in the perception\u2019 of interest rate, risk. zerodha.com/varsity 318",

    "text": "319 Now, in case any of these risks get triggered, then the fall in NAV will be steep, and the fund will take time to recover from the losses. The only way to deal with this is to ensure you stay invested in the fund for a long enough period. How long? There are different theories, but I believe that the minimum time you need to invest in a debt mutual fund should be equal to, at least the average maturity of the fund. So in this case, if I\u2019m investing in this fund, I\u2019d give it roughly 2.5 to 3 years and not below that. Similarly, if I\u2019m looking at a Gilt fund whose average maturity is ten years, then I\u2019d be prepared for a long-haul investment lasting at least ten years. The investment tenure is something you need to be super clear when investing in a debt fund.

Exposure to AA bonds is less compared to the category, and the cash equivalent is higher compared to the category.

The average maturity of the fund is 2.28, while the category\u2019s average is 2.89.

    "text": "326 For example, if the category\u2019s YTM is 6% and the fund is 8%, then it implies that the fund is taking on additional risk to chase yield. Ideally, I\u2019d like to see the fund\u2019s YTM match the category\u2019s YTM, and I\u2019m even ok with slightly lower YTM compared to the category. I want to look at the fund\u2019s market risk parameters such as the standard deviation, beta, and alpha to get a sense of how volatile the fund compared to its benchmark. Ideally, it would help if you looked at it from a 3-year prospective, but since this fund is new, we won\u2019t get that information. Lastly, I did look at the AUM of the fund; this is roughly 650Cr. Not a big fund given its category. When it comes to Debt funds, I\u2019d like to avoid investing in very small funds or very large funds. In a situation where there is a run on the AMC and the AMC faces redemption pressure, then a large debt fund will have issues with debt market liquidity. On the other hand, a small fund will never negotiate good rates with the issuers and hence is always a price taker. So it's always good to avoid both funds with either small or very large AUMs. So would I invest in this fund? I\u2019d probably hesitate to do so for a couple of reasons \u2013 \u25cb The fund has a concentrated portfolio \u25cb Credit risk is higher compared to the category \u25cb It\u2019s a new fund, and I\u2019m sure there are better alternatives in the market \u25cb The fund has a low AUM, understandable since it\u2019s a new fund zerodha.com/varsity 326",

Before we wrap up this chapters, here are few things for you to note \u2013 \u25cb Investment in debt funds is mainly for capital preservation. Do not look at returns or chase returns when investing in a debt fund \u25cb Please do not look at \u2018star ratings\u2019, of a debt fund. Usually, a debt fund is rated high if the returns are high. If a debt fund has a high return, that means the fund manager is taking on risk to chase returns. \u25cb Apart from the standard debt fund risks, keep an eye on the liquidity risk. We have discussed the liquidity risk here \u2013 https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-debt-funds-part-4/. If both the fund\u2019s AUM and the number of securities fall, then it\u2019s a red flag and an indicator of liquidity risk \u25cb SEBI has now mandated the funds to disclose portfolio details on a fortnightly basis, this is a good move. Do keep an eye on the portfolio changes \u25cb Always diversify across AMCs, for example, if you want to invest in a short term fund, then split your money across two short term funds from two different AMCs \u25cb It is best if you avoid investing in a credit risk fund. Credit risk funds take on credit risk to generate a return. In my opinion, you should not look at debt funds for returns. Use debt funds to safeguard capital zerodha.com/varsity 327",

Risk across multiples areas of life \u2013 physical health, mental health, permanent disabilities, a prolonged state of joblessness, broken relationships, and whatnot. While it is impossible to anticipate everything and get a cover, an individual should get a cover for two things in life \u2013 loss of life and hospitalization. Of course, the cover comes in the form of insurance. Term insurance will ensure that your near and dear ones, your dependents are not financially burdened a\u0000er your passing away. Health insurance will ensure you don\u2019t spend your life\u2019s earnings to pay for hospital bills while getting treated for chronic illness. Given this, you need to estimate the extent your family will be paid off if unfortunately, you pass away. Similarly, you need to figure out the extent of health insurance cover you need to get.

But I want you to be aware that as an individual, the very first step in your \u2018personal finance\u2019 journey is to ensure you get cover for these two types of risks. I want to stress that don\u2019t buy insurance products linked to investment plans. These are not worth it. Cover for an emergency \u2013 I\u2019m referring to an emergency corpus here, an emergency corpus to help you navigate your tough times. Tough time could be a job loss, or it could be as simple as having enough money to replace a piece of electronic equipment at home or a medical emergency. I understand medical emergencies are covered by health insurance but don\u2019t take that for granted. To give you an example, in September 2020, both my parents were hit by Covid 19. When I took them to the hospital, the hospital made me pay a certain amount of money for admission and cover the initial expenses. Of course, I had an insurance cover for both of them, which later came in handy, but at that moment, I needed ready cash and needed a fairly large amount. Or take this, for example \u2013 thanks to Covid 19, schools went online, and I suddenly had to equip the house with a printer and a laptop for my 10-year-old daughter. That was an unplanned financial expense but had to be done. Emergencies can come in any form and can come at any time. One has to have sufficient funds, which is easily available to you when the emergency strikes. Given this, at the very initial stages of your \u2018personal finance\u2019 journey, I\u2019d advise you to build this emergency corpus. zerodha.com/varsity 332",

    "text": "333 The question is, how much money is good enough for the emergency corpus? Different people have different opinions, but I see most of them agree to have an emergency corpus equivalent to 6 months of expense. For example, if your monthly expense is 40K, then the emergency corpus should be at least 2.4L. But I don\u2019t subscribe to the 6-month emergency corpus template. Each person is different; each family is different. It would help if you sat with your family, went through different scenarios and identified a corpus amount good enough to sail your family through these tough times. Anyway, I will make these two assumptions \u2013 that you have the basic insurance cover and have built an emergency corpus. With these things taken care of, we will now understand how to build a mutual fund portfolio. 26.2 \u2013 Financial Goal Imagine a newly married couple. Both the husband and wife are young, say in the late \u201920s, and both are working professionals. The couple aspires to buy a house of their own. Their idea of the home is a 2BHK apartment downtown, costing roughly 1.5Cr, and they give themselves a ten-year window to achieve this goal. Or think of this situation \u2013 A 40-year-old working woman wants to accumulate money to upgrade her car over the next five years. The estimated cost of the car is 55L.

With the three random scenarios that I have quoted, you can imagine how diverse each person\u2019s financial aspirations are. No two families or humans will have the same requirement (apart from retirement maybe). Financial goals are extremely diverse and very personal to your situation.

Before we proceed further, we need to understand an important aspect of the number of funds one should have in a portfolio. I\u2019ve seen investors with 10-12 mutual funds in their portfolio for a single financial goal. Usually, their portfolio will contain 3-4 large-cap funds, another 3-4 mid-cap funds, few random debt funds, and perhaps a hybrid fund tucked in. This is a classic example of a messy, directionless, and a pointless portfolio. Ideally, you need to have non-overlapping mutual funds to avoid redundancy. Let me explain, assume you have the following three large-cap funds in your portfolio \u2013 \u25cb Axis Bluechip fund \u25cb Mirae Asset Large cap fund \u25cb Canara Rob Blue chip Equity. All three funds are good, but does that mean all the three funds should belong in your portfolio. Take a look at the top 10 holdings across all the three funds \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 337",

If you extend this across all the portfolio holdings, I\u2019m sure the common overlap would be a much bigger number. Given this, the performance across these funds also tend to be similar. The economic/market factors that impact these funds will be similar, and the volatility will be similar. Hence, as an in investor, if you buy multiple funds of the same type across different AMCs, then you need to realize that there is no significant advantage in you doing so. Of course, the only argument for having two funds of the same type is AMC diversification, where you split your money across two different AMCs. You can probably do this if you worry that one of the AMCs may fold during the tenure of your investment. zerodha.com/varsity 338",

Otherwise, you just end up paying just to get the same exposure and costs can eat into your returns significantly. 26.4 \u2013 Portfolio, by the method of elimination Let us revisit the scenarios we looked at earlier and see how the table can cra\u0000 a mutual fund portfolio. Case 1 \u2013 A newly married couple, aspires to buy an apartment, estimated at 1.5Cr in 10 years. Both of them work, hence can save 30K each, every month. We have the following data \u2013 1.

When I say debt is not required, I mean not required as the main investment fund. Let me get back to this in a bit. Debt has another role to play here. The focus is clearly on Equity as the category. Within Equity as a category, we have a list of schemes available, which we need to start eliminating \u2013 \u25cb Large & Midcap \u2013 may not work, since most of these \u2018Large & Midcap funds\u2019 are mid-cap stocks anyway. \u25cb Small-cap funds \u2013 These are risky, volatile.

If the fund\u2019s investment turns out to be a mistake, the realization may come in a bit too late. \u25cb Thematic funds are sector dependent; if the call on sector goes wrong, the fund will take forever to recover. \u25cb ELSS funds \u2013 Useless one needs to save on taxes as well. \u25cb Index funds \u2013 While this is a great option, somehow, a strict 10-year period may not do justice for these funds.

Do recall we have discussed how to select an equity mutual fund in the previous chapters. The easiest way to invest the funds would be a systematic investment plan (SIP) in the selected mutual funds every month. So how do the numbers stack up assuming a CAGR of 10%?

As you can see, the couple accumulates 1.21Crs, which is quite close to the target funds over the 10-year window. A bank loan can plug in the deficit (which is not much). Now, here is another aspect to consider. What if, as and when you approach the target year, the market starts to fall and you lose the accumulated wealth? This is a possibility; a\u0000er all, no one can time the market. One way to deal with this is to start to shi\u0000 the corpus funds to a debt fund as and when you start approaching the target year. For example, from the 8th year onwards, they can withdraw the accumulated funds and park it in a debt fund.

You may ask if this a \u2018fill it, shut it\u2019 approach with no intervention during the investment tenure. Yes, this is largely a fill it and shut it approach. But once in a way (like once a year), one should track the fund\u2019s performance and take a call on continuity.

Yes, the short duration fund may not need as much scrutiny as a corporate bond fund, but it does require you to look at, at least once a quarter.

I\u2019d like to thank these folks for helping me with this module and sharing their wisdom with all of us. Read on. \u2014 In chapter 6 & 7, we discussed the basics of a mutual fund and how it works. In chapter 16, we specifically talked about index funds. I had mentioned that we would discuss a relatively new category of funds in the Indian context called smart-beta funds and ETFs, but this got delayed.

    "text": "351 The term smart-beta evokes a lot of strong opinions among investment professionals. Although it sounds fancy, it largely means nothing and is largely a marketing term. Smart-beta broadly speaking is a catch-all term for factor investing and any weighting methodology which deviates from traditional market-cap weighting. If you remember from the previous chapter on index funds, an index fund tracks a market-cap-weighted benchmark like a Ni\u0000y 50, Ni\u0000y 500 etc. Just as a refresher, a market-cap-weighted index weights stocks based on their market cap (outstanding shares X current price). Higher the market cap, higher the weight in the index. Ni\u0000y 50 is an example. Similarly, there are ETFs based on fundamentally weighted indices. For example, an index that weights stocks based on earnings, a combination of fundamental metrics such as earnings, dividends, profitability etc. 27. 2 \u2013 What is a factor; you might be wondering? A factor is a broad, persistent driver of the returns of a stock. Put another way, in factor investing, you target securities that exhibit a particular characteristic that drives their returns. Remember this definition, and we\u2019ll come back to this in a bit. But before we do, it is also important to understand a little bit of history for context. Factor investing results from continued academic research starting with the Capital asset pricing model (CAPM), efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) etc. CAPM states that a single factor, the market factor or beta, drives returns, but this didn\u2019t stick. Factor investing became mainstream when Eugene Fama zerodha.com/varsity 351",

In the paper, Fama and French added two more factors \u2013 Value and size and market factor. This meant that there were other drivers of stock returns than just market risk; this was what came to be known as the Fama French 3-factor model. In 2014 this became a 5-factor model when two new factors\u2014 profitability and investment factors were added. Apart from the famous Fama French factors, other factors like Momentum and Low Volatility also have been discovered. What do these factors mean? Here\u2019s a ni\u0000y explanation from Robeco of the most commonly used factors: zerodha.com/varsity 352 Value The tendency of inexpensive securities, relative to their fundamentals, to outperform over the longer term. Mome ntum The tendency of securities that have performed well in the recent past to continue to perform well, and for securities that have performed poorly to continue to perform poorly. Low risk Refers to the observation that low-risk securities tend to earn higher risk-adjusted returns than high-risk securities.",

    "text": "355 But, it\u2019s also important to understand why these factor premiums exist in the first place. There are broadly 3 reasons market practitioners and academics propose: Risk-based : Factor premiums exist because investors need to be compensated for the additional risk they bear. For example, academic literature shows that value stocks, i.e. cheap stocks, tend to outperform expensive stocks over the long run. But cheap stocks more o\u0000en than not tend to be cheaper because they have a higher chance of going bankrupt. Or in the case of an economic downturn, value stocks will be the first ones to go out of business. Behavioural-based: This camp believes that these factor premiums exist because of behavioural biases among investors. For example, this camp says that the value premium exists because investors chase glamorous growth stocks and ignore cheap stocks, i.e. your value stocks. Similarly, this camp believes that the momentum effect exists because of investor under-reaction and overreaction. They under-react to good news or good earnings and then over-react, causing a feedback loop which pushes prices higher. Structural issues: This camp says that factor premiums exist because of structural reasons like illiquidity, high transaction costs, difficulty in applying leverage etc. Like with all things, it\u2019s not just one thing, and it might be a combination of multiple reasons. Humans are complex beings, and the markets are complex adaptive systems. It would be unwise to conclude anything else. zerodha.com/varsity 355",

The first smart beta ETFs were just launched about 4-5 years back. There are a few quant funds from Reliance, Tata, and DSP. But unlike a smart beta ETF, the methodologies of these funds aren\u2019t fully transparent. Having said that, these are just index returns, and real-life trading performance is always different due to costs, slippage, changes in market microstructure etc. Our markets have evolved a lot since 2005 from when these indices start. You could argue that they have become a lot efficient. Given that we are just seeing the launch of the first few smart-beta funds in just the last few years, we don\u2019t have a lot of live trading data yet.

Each factor can be defined and implemented in 100 different ways. For example, as defined in Fama and French\u2019s paper, the value was the price to book, but each value ETF or index has a different methodology such as price to sales, EBIT/TEV, forward earnings, or a mix of value metrics. This leads to a wide dispersion in returns among the same or similar funds. 27.4 \u2013 Do smart-beta funds work? There are broadly speaking two views of thought. On the sceptical side, many people view factors as backtests and that they are a result of data mining that doesn\u2019t work as advertised. Then, there are a few who believe that they might have worked in the past but don\u2019t anymore. On the other side, you have true believers in factors.

You have to bear a lot of pain for that premium and have really long-term horizons to harvest that premium. Having said that investors also must be cognizant that the markets have indeed changed and keep changing over time. In the 90s, when the first factors were discovered, you could argue that the markets still had many inefficiencies and retail investors still made up a good chunk of the markets. Today, everybody has all the data at the click of a button on smartphones, and there are millions of CFA holders, hedge funds that manage trillions of dollars constantly seeking new inefficiencies. Even in India, mutual funds, PMS\u2019, AIFs, HFT traders, institutions have become dominant players in the markets. Have the factors been arbitraged away? Unlikely, investors shouldn\u2019t just look at past returns of indices and backtests and have the same expectations. The probabilities are the premiums might not be as large as they seem. The proliferation of data and computing power has also led to 100s of new factors resulting from data mining. If you look at the backtests of some of these factors, they look amazing, but they are spurious at the end of the day.

Nor do I think that smart-beta funds should be viewed as replacements for index funds or good diversified active funds that perform consistently \u2013 emphasis on good and consistent. But we\u2019ve seen in the previous chapter on index funds that a vast majority of active funds don\u2019t beat their benchmarks. I do think smart-beta funds are a good replacement for poorly managed discretionary active funds. The bulk of your equity allocation should be good consistent diversified active equity funds or in index funds. And then you can invest in smart-beta funds for that chance of extra returns. But do remember, factors can go a long time underperforming simple index funds. These premiums are also sensitive to the amount of money chasing them. So, as more such funds are launched in India, and more money flows into them, the factor premiums might not always be as large as they once were. Remember, there are no free lunches in the markets, and every choice you make as an investor comes with trade-offs. You need to endure that pain if you hope to harvest those additional returns, say, a simple index fund. One solution is to diversify among factors, there are multi-factors funds that invest in multiple factors, but we don\u2019t have many of those in India yet. ICICI alpha low volatility ETF, which was recently launched, combines two momentum and low volatility. Similarly, DSP Quant Fund and the likes of Tata Quant Fund also are multi-factor funds.

The low historical correlations that one might have seen between real-estate and stocks could\u2019ve been a function of the different venues where they were transacted, lower liquidity, long transaction times and inability to cross-leverage. But once you put all these different assets on the same platform and allow investors to lever one asset to buy another, you end up increasing their correlations.

Happy learning, -Karthik Rangappa. 29.1 \u2013 Overview In chapter 7, we looked at what a mutual fund is and how it works. To recap, a mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle that collects the money from various investors, invests and manages that money on their behalf. When you invest in a mutual fund before the order placement cut-off time, you will get the units as per the same day\u2019s NAV which is disclosed by midnight. If you invest a\u0000er the order placement cut-off time, you\u2019ll get the allotment of units per the next day\u2019s NAV. Basically, everything happens at the end of the day. Now, what if those mutual funds units could be traded on the stock exchange just like stocks like Reliance or Infosys? Just like a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment vehicle that holds a basket of securities like stocks, bonds, and commodities and trades on the stock exchanges. You can buy and sell an ETF anytime, just like a stock. zerodha.com/varsity 376",

    "text": "377 There are a few more nuances to an ETF than a mutual fund, but before we dive in, I hope you have a working idea of what an ETF is. 29.2 \u2013 History of ETFs Mutual funds have been around in some form for well over 100-years. The first open-ended mutual fund in the US was launched in 1924 and is still in existence today. The first mutual fund in India was launched in 1964. Mutual funds have democratized access to stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities globally to common investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) were the next evolution of mutual funds. ETFs, on the other hand, are relatively new. The SPDR S&P 500 trust, arguably the first ETF, was launched in 1993 in the US. Coincidentally, it is today the largest traded security in the world. Ni\u0000yBeES, an ETF tracking the Ni\u0000y 50 index was the first ETF in India and was launched in 2000. It was launched by Benchmark AMC, which Goldman Sachs later acquired, which Reliance later acquired, which Nippon India Mutual Fund later acquired \ud83d\ude42 29.3 \u2013 ETFs in India Though ETFs have been around for a while in India, they haven\u2019t really been popular among retail investors. ETFs have mostly been used by HNIs and institutions. For example, the SBI Ni\u0000y 50 ETF with Rs 89,441.55 cr is the largest mutual fund in India. This is almost entirely because this is one of the ETFs in which the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) invests. A large part of the ETF AUM growth is due to: zerodha.com/varsity 377",

Growth of ETF AUM in India Though still a small piece of the pie, retail participation has been growing steadily over the years and so has the trading turnover on the exchanges. Ni\u0000yBeES which is 20 years old, just has about Rs 2800 crores of AUM. There are a lot of reasons for the under penetration of ETFs: 1. India is still a tiny market. We just have about 1.7 crore active demat accounts, and unlike a mutual fund, you can only buy an ETF if you have a demat account. 2. Investment products, be it mutual funds or ETFs are push products. One of the reasons why mutual funds are larger than ETFs is because AMCs can pay distributors & platforms commissions to sell their mutual funds. But ETFs don\u2019t have commissions like mutual funds. zerodha.com/varsity 378",

Most AMCs rarely push ETFs because they have low margins and don\u2019t make sense with small AUMs. 29.4 \u2013 What is an ETF? An exchange-traded fund (ETF), just like a mutual fund is a basket of securities, but this is where the similarity with a mutual fund ends. Unlike a mutual fund, an ETF trades throughout the day on the stock exchanges. You can buy and sell an ETF anytime you want just like a stock.

Similarly, when you redeem your mutual funds, the AMC sells the securities and returns your money. This is quite straightforward. However, when you buy an ETF, you don\u2019t really interact with the AMC most of the time because most buying and selling happens on the stock exchanges. It\u2019s just an exchange of units between buyers and sellers. 29.6 \u2013 Creation and redemption mechanism I said when you buy an ETF, you \u201cmostly\u201d don\u2019t interact with the AMC and I\u2019ll explain what that means. If you remember chapter 6, we discussed all the entities involved in an MF transaction \u2014 the AMC, custodian and the RTA.

    "text": "382 Like a mutual fund, an ETF also has an end of the day Net Asset Value (NAV). Just to refresh your memory, NAV tells you the total value of all the fund\u2019s assets and yours. The formula for calculating NAV is NAV = (Value of all the assets \u2013 the expenses)/number of shares (units). But remember, an ETF trades real-time, whereas NAVs are only announced at the end of the day. So how do you figure out if the price you are paying for an ETF is fair in real-time? Enter iNAV Intraday or indicative net asset value (iNAV) Given that ETFs trade real-time, you need a reference point to see if the market price you see on your trading platform is a fair one and the indicative or intraday NAV (iNAV) serves as that reference. AMCs usually calculate this every 10-15 seconds and publish it on their websites. iNAV = last traded price of all the securities in the ETF basket X number of shares in the ETF creation basket + cash component (i.e. cash which is not deployed in the ETF) divided by total ETF shares in the creation basket. Put simply; this serves as a real-time NAV so that you can use this as a fair value reference to compare it with the current market price on the stock exchanges. Creation unit Like buying ETF units on the stock exchange, you can also buy units directly from the AMC. I\u2019ll explain why you\u2019d want to do that later. But, unlike the exchanges, you cannot buy 1 or 2 units directly from the AMC. You can only create and redeem units in what\u2019s called the creation size that the AMC defines. A creation unit is nothing but a representative basket of all the securities in the same proportion as the underlying index. For example, the zerodha.com/varsity 382",

Meaning, you need 80 lakhs to buy all the stocks in Ni\u0000y 50 in the same weight. Market makers and authorized participants (APs) Unlike mutual funds, there\u2019s another entity called market markers or authorized participants in the ETF ecosystem. The role of these guys is to provide liquidity on the stock exchanges. You don\u2019t have to worry about liquidity in a mutual fund because there\u2019s no real-time trading. But since an ETF trades real-time on the exchange, market makers are appointed by the AMC to provide liquidity continuously. They do this by providing continuous two-way quotes on the exchange, meaning they buy at the bid and sell at the offer , and the difference is the profit they make. Even though these are small amounts, since they keep doing this, it tends to add up. Market makers typically tend to be large brokers in India. Premiums and discounts Since an ETF trades real-time on the exchanges, their price is influenced by demand and supply\u2014the prices of liquid ETFs trade in line with the NAV of the ETF most of the time. But sometimes, particularly during volatile market phases, the price of an ETF can trade away from the NAV of the ETF. If the price of an ETF is above its NAV, it\u2019s called a premium and if the price is below it\u2019s NAV, it\u2019s called a discount. Tracking error zerodha.com/varsity 383",

    "text": "384 Tracking error is the annualized standard deviation of the difference between the ETF NAV returns and the index that it tracks. In simple terms, it shows you how closely an ETF tracks its underlying benchmark. A simple example would be if Ni\u0000y 50 returned 10% and Ni\u0000y ETF gave 9.8%, the tracking error would be 0.2%. An ETF or an index fund will have lower returns than the index because they have an expense ratio and an index doesn\u2019t. A lower tracking error indicates that an ETF or an index fund is tracking the index better. But this is not really an intuitive measure to understand and we\u2019ll discuss that later. With these concepts in mind, let\u2019s get back to the concept of creation and redemption mechanism There are a few reasons why the creation and redemption mechanism is important. For one, you need not always buy an ETF on the stock exchange. If you are buying in multiples of the creation unit size, buying it directly from the AMC is way better because you might face liquidity issues and impact costs when you buy large quantities on the exchange. So, in the example I mentioned above, the ICICI Ni\u0000y 50 ETF\u2019s creation size is roughly 80 lakhs. If you are investing in multiples of 80 lakhs, you can directly contact ICICI, and they will create units, in this case, 50,000 units and credit them to your demat. The AMC will create units at the iNAV. Similarly, you can redeem them by transferring the ETF units to ICICI, and they will credit the cash to your bank account or you can also get the underlying shares instead of cash. zerodha.com/varsity 384",

    "text": "385 The second reason why creation and redemption mechanisms are important is for ETF arbitrage. Like I mentioned earlier, ETFs can trade at premiums and discounts to the NAV. Market makers are essential in the ETF ecosystem because they are responsible for correcting these premiums and discounts. They do this through the creation and redemption mechanism. Typically ETFs trade close to their NAVs. Here\u2019s a comparison of Ni\u0000y BeEs, SBI Ni\u0000y ETF, ICICI ETF and Ni\u0000y 50. Ni\u0000y ETFs vs Ni\u0000y 50 But during a volatile market phase, for example, like the COVID crash in 2020, there can be wide premiums and discounts.

If there\u2019s a premium, the authorized participant (AP) will buy all the underlying securities that make up the ETF creation unit. In this case, the AP will buy all the 50 Ni\u0000y stocks of the same weight; this is also called the creation basket and give them to the AMC. In turn, the AMC will create ETF shares and give them to the AP, who will then sell them on the exchange. Similarly, if there\u2019s a discount, the AP will buy the ETF units on the exchange and give them to the AMC. In return, the AMC will give the underlying shares of the ETF to the AP, who will, in turn, sell them in the market. The difference between the premium, discount, and the NAV will be the AP/market maker\u2019s profit. Perhaps, the best example of this would be the Motilal Oswal NASDAQ 100 (N100). During 2017-2018, the ETF was trading at a huge premium to the NAV. The premiums were as high as 20%+. This was probably because the market makers weren\u2019t active in providing liquidity.

In the Indian markets, the liquidity quickly starts disappearing a\u0000er the 200 largest stocks. As we go down the market cap, the smaller stocks tend to have less outstanding shares, less trading volumes, and usually keep hitting upper and lower circuits. So, assuming there was a small-cap ETF and that there was a sudden spike in demand, the market maker would have had to create units to satisfy the demand. Now if some of the underlying stocks are not liquid or have hit circuits, which is quite common in small-caps, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to create units. In such a case, the ETF will probably trade at a premium to the NAV because there will be more demand for the existing units. Not just, small-caps, even mid-cap stocks in India have liquidity issues. So, an ETF can only be as liquid as it\u2019s underlying stocks. But this isn\u2019t a problem in a large-cap ETF like a Ni\u0000y 50 ETF because these are the biggest and the most liquid stocks. To summarize, trading volumes and AUM are factors, but they don\u2019t tell you everything about an ETF. 29.8 \u2013 ETF choices in India Like I mentioned at the start of the chapter, ETFs are pretty new in India, we have about 88 ETFs today. A majority of them are equity ETFs. Here are your ETF choices: 1. Equity ETFs There broadly 2 sub-categories of equity ETFs. You have your plain zerodha.com/varsity 392",

Debt ETFs We have debt G-sec ETFs, Bharat bond ETF which just holds bonds issued by PSUs, and then you have an ETF like the CPSE+SDL ETF by Nippon which holds PSU bonds and State development loans (SDLs). 3. Commodity ETFs For now, we just have gold ETFs. Here\u2019s a list of all Indian ETFs. Are all ETFs passive? This is a common question that keeps coming up. Today, the biggest ETFs we have are passive ETFs that track either the Ni\u0000y 50 or Sensex 30. But smart beta ETFs aren\u2019t passive, even though the ETFs track an index. They are more of a hybrid of active & passive like we discussed in the smart beta chapter. Globally, 80-90% of all ETFs are passive, but we see the first traditional active ETFs in the US. Maybe, we\u2019ll eventually see them in India as well. So ETFs need not be all passive, it\u2019s just that they are passive today. ETF due diligence I know this has been a little long, but the idea was to give you the full context you need before investing in an ETF and help you avoid rude surprises.

Always use limit orders I cannot stress this enough but never use market orders when buying an ETF, always use limit orders. This is one mistake I see investors constantly make. We saw this earlier but let me reiterate this with an example. Take a look at the market depth of Aditya Birla Sun Life Ni\u0000y Next 50 ETF. If you placed a market order for 200 units, your order would be executed at prices starting from Rs 350, which is above the LTP, to begin with, and finally, at Rs 374, that\u2019s 8.7% higher than the LTP. So, always use limit orders. Market depth of Aditya Birla Ni\u0000y Next 50 ETF zerodha.com/varsity 394",

    "text": "395 Always check the iNAV Always look at the iNAV on the AMC website and place a limit order at that level. Don\u2019t just place a limit order without looking at the iNAV. The other issue is that sometimes AMC websites don\u2019t update their iNAVs or their websites might be down. If there is a big difference between the last updated iNAV and the current market price, that\u2019s a sign that there is something wrong. So, make sure to compare the ETF with the intraday chart of the underlying index of the ETF on Kite, and that will give you an indication if the price is correct. Check with the AMC in such a case before placing an order. Compare the NAV and the price of an ETF and see how it has performed You should always buy an ETF that tracks the underlying index as closely as possible. Here\u2019s how Nippon Ni\u0000yBeEs ETF has tracked it\u2019s NAV, it\u2019s pretty close. You can compare the price and the NAV on Value Research; we\u2019ll try having this feature on Coin.

    "text": "396 Picking up on the earlier point about the tracking error, AMCs disclose the tracking error on their factsheets. But if you see a tracking error as 0.02%, it\u2019s hard to understand what it means. Moreover, AMCs calculate the tracking error on the NAV, but you buy and sell based on the price, which can be totally different. So the best way to analyse an ETF is to look at the difference between ETF prices and the underlying index. You want the price of ETF to track the index consistently without huge differences. Note: Always compare the ETF price with the total returns index (TRI) and not the price returns the index (PRI). The TRI includes dividends. All the index data you see on Kite is PRI. Since ETFs track TRI indices, they reinvest the dividends which reflects in the NAV of the ETF. Look at the average volumes Look at the average volumes over a period of time and see how an ETF has traded. You should invest in an ETF that trades regularly. You should avoid ETFs that just have a brief spike in volumes and then don\u2019t trade. The Edelweiss ETF \u2013 Ni\u0000y 100 Quality 30 is an example. The monthly average volumes are about 150 units. You can check the average volumes by applying a moving average on the volume chart on Kite. So assuming you had bought this ETF and had to exit, you most likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to. zerodha.com/varsity 396",

They also tend to trade at abnormal prices because of the low volumes, even orders for a few units can move prices. If you can, avoid trading in the open. And if you have to, check and verify the iNAV and use limit orders. Is the AMC focussed on ETFs? Today, most of the AMCs offer ETFs but that doesn't mean they are serious about them. Most of the ETF volumes are in ETFs offered by Nippon, ICICI, and SBI largely. Other AMCs like Mirae, Edelweiss with their debt ETFs do seem serious about building out their ETF offerings. So, along with the other things on the due diligence list, you\u2019ll also have to look at whether an AMC is serious about the ETFs it offers. For example, if you look at some of the ETFs by Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, IDBI, LIC, Indiabulls etc., they have horrible tracking errors and almost no volumes. zerodha.com/varsity 397",

In the last decade or so, index funds and ETFs have become increasingly popular around the world. One reason is that investors have increasingly realized that a vast majority of actively managed mutual funds don\u2019t beat their benchmarks. In a developed market like the US, ~90% of active funds don\u2019t beat their benchmarks. The Indian markets have grown a fair bit and have become increasingly professionalized; institutional investors are a big part of today\u2019s market. This means that most of the informational edges and asymmetries have been arbitraged away. Today, pretty much everyone has access to the same information. The odds of someone finding some piece of information that can move a stock, at least in the large-cap space, for example, is pretty much zero. zerodha.com/varsity 400 Index funds tend to hold more cash and hence have a slightly higher tracking error ETFs don\u2019t hold much cash and hence have a lower tracking error Lesser choice at-least as of now.

Actively managed large-cap funds on an average charge~1.5% whereas a Ni\u0000y 50 index fund is available for 0.10%. And we see this in the performance. S&P publishes a report called SPIVA, which measures the performance of active funds. For any period, over 70% of all large-cap funds fail to beat their benchmarks. SPIVA India Traditionally, the view was that the mid-cap and small-cap space was inefficient, and this was where stock pickers thrived. While this was true, it seems like this is increasingly becoming less so. In the last 5 years since the SEBI categorization exercise, active mid-cap funds have had a tough time keeping up with a broad mid-cap benchmark like the Ni\u0000y 50 or BSE/NSE Mid-cap 150 index and even Ni\u0000y Next 50 etc. Here\u2019s a quick look, this is just for illustration, and ideally, you should look at the rolling returns. zerodha.com/varsity 401 3 Yr Ret (%) 5 Yr Ret (%) 10 Yr Ret (%)",

This is due to a combination of high costs, increasing market efficiency, and internal fund mandates to not deviate too much from the indices.

The neighbour\u2019s house had three family members \u2013 husband and wife, both in their mid 50\u2019s and a teenage daughter. Husband managed a steel kitchenware shop, which sold household items like rice cooker, pots, and pans. His wife managed a small homemade papad and pickle business, and the teenage daughter taught classical dance to the neighbourhood kids. All three members of the house had an economic output. Given my unnecessary curiosity, I remember trying to figure out how much money this family made. I don\u2019t remember the exact math, but I remember these numbers; I estimated that \u2013 \u25cb The husband sold goods worth 2 to 2.5L lakhs per month. \u25cb The wife sold goods worth 25K every month. \u25cb The daughter charged 500 per month per kid and had ten students, which was 5K per month. zerodha.com/varsity 409",

But the stock markets at least seem to factor this \ud83d\ude42 Anyway, at this point, I want you to take a break and think about this \u2013 \u25cb You understood what GDP is \u25cb You understood the GDP growth rate, both nominal and real. How is this relevant to personal finance? 30.3 \u2013 GDP and Market cap We have discussed the concept of market cap earlier in Varsity.

The market cap of this company is \u2013 Stock price x total outstanding shares = 75 x 1000 = Rs.75,000/- The total outstanding shares of this company are constant, but the stock price fluctuates daily. The higher the stock price, the higher is the market cap and vice versa. Now assume another company has 2000 shares outstanding, and the stock price is 105 per share. The market cap of this company is \u2013 = 105 x 2000 =2,10,000/- Now assume (the last assumption, I promise) that the entire market comprises just these two companies. The entire market cap of this market is \u2013 75000 + 210000 =2,85,000/- Hopefully, with this arbitrary example, you got a sense of the concept of \u2018market cap of the market\u2019.

    "text": "416 One of the direct established correlations is that as the country\u2019s GDP improves, so will the market cap. If the market cap does well, then equity investments are bound to well. We have seen this happen in the past. So when you look at the GDP data, think about how the country is placed in terms of GDP, and it is expected to do over the next 5 or 10 years. For instance, here is a thought about the Indian GDP situation \u2013 \u25cb India is a 2.6 Trillion USD GDP as of 2021 \u25cb The real GDP growth rate is 5.5% \u25cb The countries above us in the GDP rank, i.e. Japan, Germany, and the UK, have large GDPs, but their real growth rates are lower. Even if India did nothing spectacular or did nothing stupid to degrow, then under a decent real GDP growth rate (and slow down in developed countries), the GDP rank is bound to increase. zerodha.com/varsity 416",

Well, these are factors that usually are a precursor to attracting more investment capital into the country. With these investments coming in, corporates are expected to do well, and in turn, the country\u2019s market cap is expected to do well. Will this happen overnight? No. Will this happen over the next 1-2 years? Maybe not. Will this happen over the next 8-10 years? Well, it seems likely. Hence, the need to stay invested for a longer-term. 30.4 \u2013 India Inc Think about a corporate entity. A corporate entity or a company usually has few sources of revenue and a set of expenses. The difference between the revenue and expense, if positive, results in a profit to the company. If the difference between the revenue and expense is negative, then that is a loss to the company. Now think about India as a company. The company\u2019s management is the Government, which is democratically elected. The company has a few revenue sources, mainly in terms of taxes, and the company also has expenses mainly in terms of capital and revenue expenses. If the income minus expense is positive, that\u2019s a surplus to the country, else a deficit. zerodha.com/varsity 417",

Let us break this down to understand the numbers better. The first line here details India Inc\u2019s Revenue; it is called the \u2018Revenue Receipts\u2019. These receipts act as the sources of revenue for the Government. There are two broad categories of revenue for the Government, i.e. Taxes and Non-tax revenue. Taxes Revenue \u2013 Tax revenue includes all sorts of taxes that the Government collects. Broadly, taxes can be classified as \u2018Direct Taxes\u2019 and \u2018Indirect Taxes\u2019. zerodha.com/varsity 418",

    "text": "419 The direct taxes include taxes paid by individuals, called the \u2018Personal Income taxes\u2019 and the corporates\u2019 taxes, called the \u2018Corporate Income tax\u2019. Indirect taxes mainly include the tax in the form of \u2018GST\u2019. As you can see, India Inc collected close to 14.8L Crore as taxes in 2018-19; this includes both direct and indirect taxes. Remember, when GST is charged, a portion goes to the state and a portion to the centre. Hence when you look at 14.8LCr, this is the \u2018net to the centre\u2019, which means that the actual tax collection is higher than 14.8L Cr. Of course, you can get the exact value by inspecting this report further, but I\u2019ll refrain from doing so. But if I remember right, roughly 2/3rd is retained by the centre, 1/3 is distributed to states. Non-tax revenue \u2013 Apart from the tax revenue, the Government has a \u2018non-tax revenue\u2019 as an income source. The non-tax revenue source mainly includes the dividends paid out by the PSU companies (companies like LIC, NTPCL, ONGC, NALCO etc.), where the Government of India is a majority stakeholder. Apart from dividend income, the Government also has revenue by selling stakes in these companies, o\u0000en referred to as the disinvestment program. The non-tax revenue for 2018-19 was roughly 2.4L Cr. Total revenue is the sum of these two revenue lines, which is roughly 18.2L Cr. The Government has expenses, and these expenses can be categorized into two buckets, i.e. the \u2018Revenue Expenditure\u2019 and \u2018Capital Expenditure. Revenue Expenditure \u2013 These expenditures include subsidies across various Government schemes, salaries to Govt employees, interest payments etc. The zerodha.com/varsity 419",

    "text": "420 revenue expenditure is a big bill that the Govt has to pay, and as we can see from the snapshot, this bill stood at 21.4L. Capital Expenditure \u2013 The capital expenditure, on the other hand, is the Government\u2019s expenditure on infrastructure; this includes things like roads, bridges, hospitals, electrical grids, transportation etc. The capital expenditure is 3.1L Crore. Think about it, capital expenditure is 3.1L Cr, while the revenue expenditure is nearly seven times more at 21L Cr. If the Govt were to spend more on Capital expenditure, it leads to better infrastructure, spurs business growth, creates jobs, and leads to better tax collection. As a long-term investor, you need to keep track of trends in these spend patterns and get a sense of how the country is evolving. The sum of revenue and capital expenditure is the total expenditure of the Govt, which is roughly 24.57Cr. So, on the one hand, Govt collected revenue of 18.2L Cr, and on the other hand, the expenses stood at 24.57Cr. The expenses are much higher than the income. The negative difference, i.e. to the extent of nearly 6.3L Cr, is called the \u2018Fiscal Deficit\u2019. From the same report, I\u2019ve pulled the GDP data \u2013 zerodha.com/varsity 420",

If you calculate the Fiscal Deficit as a percentage of GDP \u2013 6.3L Cr / 190.1L Cr = 3.3% Any macroeconomic debate or discussion, this is the ratio that gets spoken about the most. The Government puts in massive efforts to contain the Fiscal Deficit to GDP ratio to sub 4%. To put this in perspective, do check this extract from Wikipedia \u2013 The US\u2019s fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is nearly 4.7%, which is quite staggering. zerodha.com/varsity 421",

Tax collection as a percentage of GDP is an important metric; remember, the higher the tax collection, the higher is the revenue, which means the probability of shrinking the fiscal deficit is higher. So what will lead to higher tax collection? Things like newer job creation, business expansion, improvement in ease of doing business, greater compliance, etc., result in higher tax collection. Again, to remind you, you need to track these numbers to understand how the country operates. Remember, when you invest in the long term, your fortunes depend on how your investments perform, depending on how India as a country performs. Without a sense of these basic details, it is equivalent to investing in the dark.

In case of \"non - business cases \", option to choose the regime can be exercised every year directly in the ITR to be filed on or before the due date specified under section 139(1). In case of taxpayers having \u201c income from business and profession\u201d and who want to opt out of new tax regime, the assessee would be required to furnish Form 10 - IEA on or before the due date u/s 139(1) for furnishing the return of income. Also, for the purpose of withdrawal of such option i.e. opting out of old tax regime shall also be done by way of furnishing Form No.10 - IEA. New tax regime is the default tax regime. However, taxpayers can opt for the old regime. New vs. Old Tax Regime> FAQs 1) What is the difference between the old and new tax regime?

    "text": "2 3) Is it necessary for the employee to intimate the tax regime to the employer? Yes , the employee has to intimate the employer regarding his intended tax regime during the year. If the employee does not make an intimation, it shall be presumed that the employee continues to be in the default tax regime and has not exercised the option to opt out of the new tax regime. Thus, the employer shall deduct tax in accordance with the rates provided under section 115BAC. However, the intimation made to the employer would not amount to exercising the option in sub - section (6) of section 115BAC for opting out of the new tax regime. The employee shall be required to do so separately before the due date specified under section 139(1) for filing of return of income. 4) I am a salaried taxpayer.
